The inline assembly version is, in theory, the fastest option, though clearly not portable; I've included it as a baseline to compare the other versions against. In my tests, with built-ins, the 4 * atan(1) version is fastest on GCC 4.2, because it auto-folds the atan(1) into a constant. With -fno-builtin specified, the atan2(0, -1) version is fastest. Here's the main testing program (pitimes.c): #include <math.h> #include <stdio.h> #include <time.h> #define ITERS 10000000 #define TESTWITH(x) { \\ diff = 0.0; \\ time1 = clock(); \\ for (i = 0; i < ITERS; ++i) \\ diff += (x) - M_PI; \\ time2 = clock(); \\ printf(\"%s\\t=> %e, time => %f\\n\", #x, diff, diffclock(time2, time1)); \\ } static inline double diffclock(clock_t time1, clock_t time0) { return (double) (time1 - time0) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC; } int main() { int i; clock_t time1, time2; double diff; /* Warmup.

I only share this because I think it is simple enough that anyone can remember it, indefinitely, plus it teaches you the concept of \"Monte-Carlo\" methods -- which are statistical methods of arriving at answers that don't immediately appear to be deducible through random processes. Draw a square, and inscribe a quadrant (one quarter of a semi-circle) inside that square (a quadrant with radius equal to the side of the square, so it fills as much of the square as possible) Now throw a dart at the square, and record where it lands -- that is, choose a random point anywhere inside the square. Of course, it landed inside the square, but is it inside the semi-circle? Record this fact. Repeat this process many times -- and you will find there is a ratio of the number of points inside the semi-circle versus the total number thrown, call this ratio x. Since the area of the square is r times r, you can deduce that the area of the semi circle is x times r times r (that is, x times r squared). Hence x times 4 will give you pi. This is not a quick method to use. But it's a nice example of a Monte Carlo method. And if you look around, you may find that many problems otherwise outside your computational skills can be solved by such methods. "}

Without going into details, the attack attempts to execute SQL code by encoding the T-SQL commands in an ASCII encoded BINARY string.

I tried to write a simple decode tool, so I could decode this type of text without even touching SQL Server. The main part I need decoded is: CAST(0x44004500...06F007200 AS NVARCHAR(4000)) I've tried all of the following commands with no luck: txtDecodedText.Text = System.Web.HttpUtility.UrlDecode(txtURLText.Text); txtDecodedText.Text = Encoding.ASCII.GetString(Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(txtURLText.Text)); txtDecodedText.Text = Encoding.Unicode.GetString(Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes(txtURLText.Text)); txtDecodedText.Text = Encoding.ASCII.GetString(Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes(txtURLText.Text)); txtDecodedText.Text = Encoding.Unicode.GetString(Convert.FromBase64String(txtURLText.Text)); What is the proper way to translate this encoding without using SQL Server? Is it possible? I'll take VB.NET code since I'm familiar with that too. Okay, I'm sure I'm missing something here, so here's where I'm at. Since my input is a basic string, I started with just a snippet of the encoded portion - 4445434C41 (which translates to DECLA) - and the first attempt was to do this... txtDecodedText.Text = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(txtURL.Text)); ...and all it did was return the exact same thing that I put in, since it converted each character into is byte. I realized that I need to parse each two characters into a byte manually since I don't know of any methods yet that will do that, so now my little decoder looks something like this: while (!boolIsDone) { bytURLChar = byte.Parse(txtURLText.Text.Substring(intParseIndex, 2)); bytURL[intURLIndex] = bytURLChar; intParseIndex += 2; intURLIndex++; if (txtURLText.Text.Length - intParseIndex < 2) { boolIsDone = true; } } txtDecodedText.Text = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(bytURL); Things look good for the first couple of pairs, but then the loop balks when it gets to the \"4C\" pair and says that the string is in the incorrect format. Interestingly enough, when I step through the debugger and to the GetString method on the byte array that I was able to parse up to that point, I get \",-+\" as the result. How do I figure out what I'm missing - do I need to do a \"direct cast\" for each byte instead of attempting to parse it? "}

{"user":"34","questionId":"104","creationDate":"2008-08-01T15:28:12.543","answerId":"112","type":"answer","body":"The best explanation I've seen is in Chapter 7 of the free Foundations of Programming ebook. Basically, in .NET a memory leak occurs when referenced objects are rooted and thus cannot be garbage collected. This occurs accidentally when you hold on to references beyond the intended scope. You'll know that you have leaks when you start getting outofmemoryexceptions or your memory usage goes up beyond what you'd expect (perfmon has nice memory counters). Understanding .NET's memory model is your best way of avoiding it. Specifically, understanding how the garbage collector works and how references work (again, I refer you to chapter 7 of the ebook). Also, be mindful of common pitfalls, probably the most common being events. If object A registered to an event on object B, then object A will stick around until object B disappears because B holds a reference to A. The solution is to unregister your events when you're done. Of course, a good memory profile will let you see your object graphs and explore the nesting/referencing of your objects to see where references are coming from and what root object is responsible (red-gate ants profile, JetBrains dotMemory, memprofiler are really good choices, or you can use the text-only windbg and sos, but I'd strongly recommend a commercial/visual product unless you're a real guru).

{"user":"42","questionId":"104","creationDate":"2008-08-01T17:52:46.293","answerId":"159","type":"answer","body":"Strictly speaking, a memory leak is consuming memory that is \"no longer used\" by the program. \"No longer used\" has more than one meaning, it could mean \"no more reference to it\", that is, totally unrecoverable, or it could mean, referenced, recoverable, unused but the program keeps the references anyway. Only the later applies to .Net for perfectly managed objects. However, not all classes are perfect and at some point an underlying unmanaged implementation could leak resources permanently for that process. In all cases, the application consumes more memory than strictly needed. The sides effects, depending on the ammount leaked, could go from none, to slowdown caused by excessive collection, to a series of memory exceptions and finally a fatal error followed by forced process termination. You know an application has a memory problem when monitoring shows that more and more memory is allocated to your process after each garbage collection cycle. In such case, you are either keeping too much in memory, or some underlying unmanaged implementation is leaking. For most leaks, resources are recovered when the process is terminated, however some resources are not always recovered in some precise cases, GDI cursor handles are notorious for that. Of course, if you have an interprocess communication mechanism, memory allocated in the other process would not be freed until that process frees it or terminates. "}

The existence of a running copy of SQL Server 6.5 in 2008 is absurd. That stipulated, what is the best way to migrate from 6.5 to 2005? Is there any direct path? Most of the documentation I've found deals with upgrading 6.5 to 7. Should I forget about the native SQL Server upgrade utilities, script out all of the objects and data, and try to recreate from scratch? I was going to attempt the upgrade this weekend, but server issues pushed it back till next. So, any ideas would be welcomed during the course of the week. Update. This is how I ended up doing it: Back up the database in question and Master on 6.5. Execute SQL Server 2000's instcat.sql against 6.5's Master. This allows SQL Server 2000's OLEDB provider to connect to 6.5. Use SQL Server 2000's standalone \"Import and Export Data\" to create a DTS package, using OLEDB to connect to 6.5. This successfully copied all 6.5's tables to a new 2005 database (also using OLEDB). Use 6.5's Enterprise Manager to script out all of the database's indexes and triggers to a .sql file. Execute that .sql file against the new copy of the database, in 2005's Management Studio. Use 6.5's Enterprise Manager to script out all of the stored procedures. Execute that .sql file against the 2005 database. Several dozen sprocs had issues making them incompatible with 2005. Mainly non-ANSI joins and quoted identifier issues. Corrected all of those issues and re-executed the .sql file. Recreated the 6.5's logins in 2005 and gave them appropriate permissions. There was a bit of rinse/repeat when correcting the stored procedures (there were hundreds of them to correct), but the upgrade went great otherwise. Being able to use Management Studio instead of Query Analyzer and Enterprise Manager 6.5 is such an amazing difference. A few report queries that took 20-30 seconds on the 6.5 database are now running in 1-2 seconds, without any modification, new indexes, or anything. I didn't expect that kind of immediate improvement. "}

As far as I know there are no perfect solutions. If you only need to store the database structure and not the data you can export the database as SQL queries. (in Enterprise Manager: Right click on database -> Generate SQL script. I recommend setting the \"create one file per object\" on the options tab) You can then commit these text files to svn and make use of svn's diff and logging functions. I have this tied together with a Batch script that takes a couple parameters and sets up the database. I also added some additional queries that enter default data like user types and the admin user. (If you want more info on this, post something and I can put the script somewhere accessible) If you need to keep all of the data as well, I recommend keeping a back up of the database and using Redgate (http://www.red-gate.com/) products to do the comparisons.

I can make them persistent: class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base before_filter :update_session_expiration_date private def update_session_expiration_date options = ActionController::Base.session_options unless options[:session_expires] options[:session_expires] = 1.year.from_now end end end But that seems like a hack, which is surprising for such common functionality. Is there any better way? Edit Gareth's answer is pretty good, but I would still like an answer from someone familiar with Rails 2 (because of it's unique CookieSessionStore). "}

I choose not to put schema dumps in under version control as alumb and others suggest because I want an easy way to upgrade my production database. For a web application where I'll have a single production database instance, I use two techniques: Database Upgrade Scripts A sequence database upgrade scripts that contain the DDL necessary to move the schema from version N to N+1. (These go in your version control system.) A _version_history_ table, something like create table VersionHistory ( Version int primary key, UpgradeStart datetime not null, UpgradeEnd datetime ); gets a new entry every time an upgrade script runs which corresponds to the new version. This ensures that it's easy to see what version of the database schema exists and that database upgrade scripts are run only once. Again, these are not database dumps. Rather, each script represents the changes necessary to move from one version to the next. They're the script that you apply to your production database to \"upgrade\" it. Developer Sandbox Synchronization A script to backup, sanitize, and shrink a production database. Run this after each upgrade to the production DB. A script to restore (and tweak, if necessary) the backup on a developer's workstation. Each developer runs this script after each upgrade to the production DB.

Also, it all depends on what kind of accuracy you are looking for. The fastest pi I know of is the digits hard coded. Looking at Pi and Pi[PDF], there are a lot of formulas. Here is a method that converges quickly (~14digits per iteration). The current fastest application, PiFast, uses this formula with the FFT. I'll just write the formula, since the code is straight forward. This formula was almost found by Ramanujan and discovered by Chudnovsky. It is actually how he calculated several billion digits of the number --so it isn't a method to disregard. The formula will overflow quickly since we are dividing factorials, it would be advantageous then to delay such calculating to remove terms. where, Below is the Brent\u2013Salamin algorithm. Wikipedia mentions that when a and b are 'close enough' then (a+b)^2/4t will be an approximation of pi. I'm not sure what 'close enough' means, but from my tests, one iteration got 2digits, two got 7, and three had 15, of course this is with doubles, so it might have error based on its representation and the 'true' calculation could be more accurate. let pi_2 iters = let rec loop_ a b t p i = if i = 0 then a,b,t,p else let a_n = (a +. b) /. 2.0 and b_n = sqrt (a*.b) and p_n = 2.0 *. p in let t_n = t -.

Using JavaScript to hash the password is not safe. Common pitfalls for client-side password hashing: If the connection between the client and server is unencrypted, everything you do is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. An attacker could replace the incoming javascript to break the hashing or send all credentials to their server, they could listen to client responses and impersonate the users perfectly, etc. etc. SSL with trusted Certificate Authorities is designed to prevent MitM attacks. The hashed password received by the server is less secure if you don't do additional, redundant work on the server. There's another secure method called SRP, but it's patented (although it is freely licensed) and there are few good implementations available. Storing passwords Don't ever store passwords as plaintext in the database. Not even if you don't care about the security of your own site. Assume that some of your users will reuse the password of their online bank account. So, store the hashed password, and throw away the original. And make sure the password doesn't show up in access logs or application logs. The best hashing function seems to be bcrypt. Hashes by themselves are also insecure. For instance, identical passwords mean identical hashes--this makes hash lookup tables an effective way of cracking lots of passwords at once. Instead, store the salted hash. A salt is a string appended to the password prior to hashing - use a different (random) salt per user. The salt is a public value, so you can store them with the hash in the database. See here for more on this. This means that you can't send the user their forgotten passwords (because you only have the hash). Don't reset the user's password unless you have authenticated the user (users must prove that they are able to read emails sent to the stored (and validated) email address.) Security questions Security questions are insecure - avoid using them. Why? Anything a security question does, a password does better. Read PART III: Using Secret Questions in @Jens Roland answer here in this wiki. Session cookies After the user logs in, the server sends the user a session cookie. The server can retrieve the username or id from the cookie, but nobody else can generate such a cookie (TODO explain mechanisms). Cookies can be hijacked: they are only as secure as the rest of the client's machine and other communications. They can be read from disk, sniffed in network traffic, lifted by a cross-site scripting attack, phished from a poisoned DNS so the client sends their cookies to the wrong servers. Don't send persistent cookies. Cookies should expire at the end of the client session (browser close or leaving your domain). If you want to autologin your users, you can set a persistent cookie, but it should be distinct from a full-session cookie. You can set an additional flag that the user has auto-logged in, and needs to login for real for sensitive operations. This is popular with shopping sites that want to provide you with a seamless, personalized shopping experience but still protect your financial details. For example, when you return to visit Amazon, they show you a page that looks like you're logged in, but when you go to place an order (or change your shipping address, credit card etc.), they ask you to confirm your password.

{"user":"154","questionId":"564","creationDate":"2008-08-02T21:55:45.477","answerId":"566","type":"answer","body":"In Java, the 'int' type is a primitive , whereas the 'Integer' type is an object. In C#, the 'int' type is the same as System.Int32 and is a value type (ie more like the java 'int'). An integer (just like any other value types) can be boxed (\"wrapped\") into an object. The differences between objects and primitives are somewhat beyond the scope of this question, but to summarize: Objects provide facilities for polymorphism, are passed by reference (or more accurately have references passed by value), and are allocated from the heap. Conversely, primitives are immutable types that are passed by value and are often allocated from the stack. "}
{"user":"58","questionId":"564","creationDate":"2008-08-02T22:05:08.093","answerId":"568","type":"answer","body":"Well, in Java an int is a primitive while an Integer is an Object. Meaning, if you made a new Integer: Integer i = new Integer(6); You could call some method on i: String s = i.toString();//sets s the string representation of i Whereas with an int: int i = 6; You cannot call any methods on it, because it is simply a primitive. So: String s = i.toString();//will not work!!! would produce an error, because int is not an object. int is one of the few primitives in Java (along with char and some others). I'm not 100% sure, but I'm thinking that the Integer object more or less just has an int property and a whole bunch of methods to interact with that property (like the toString() method for example). So Integer is a fancy way to work with an int (Just as perhaps String is a fancy way to work with a group of chars). I know that Java isn't C, but since I've never programmed in C this is the closest I could come to the answer. Hope this helps! Integer object javadoc Integer Ojbect vs. int primitive comparison "}

I am always a bit careful when working with binary data, as this seems to be a compatiblity issue (even though development and live should run the same version of the server at all time). Or - given the lack of \"EXPLAIN CREATE TABLE\" in T-SQL - do you do something that exports an existing database into SQL-Scripts which you can run on the target server? If yes, is there a tool that can automatically dump a given Database into SQL Queries and that runs off the command line? (Again, Enterprise Manager/Management Studio Express do not count). And lastly - given the fact that the live database already contains data, the deployment may not involve creating all tables but rather checking the difference in structure and ALTER TABLE the live ones instead, which may also need data verification/conversion when existing fields change. Now, i hear a lot of great stuff about the Red Gate products, but for hobby projects, the price is a bit steep. So, what are you using to automatically deploy SQL Server Databases from Test to Live?

{"user":"111","questionId":"580","creationDate":"2008-08-03T00:37:03.903","answerId":"591","type":"answer","body":"I work the same way Karl does, by keeping all of my SQL scripts for creating and altering tables in a text file that I keep in source control. In fact, to avoid the problem of having to have a script examine the live database to determine what ALTERs to run, I usually work like this: On the first version, I place everything during testing into one SQL script, and treat all tables as a CREATE. This means I end up dropping and readding tables a lot during testing, but that's not a big deal early into the project (since I'm usually hacking the data I'm using at that point anyway). On all subsequent versions, I do two things: I make a new text file to hold the upgrade SQL scripts, that contain just the ALTERs for that version. And I make the changes to the original, create a fresh database script as well. This way an upgrade just runs the upgrade script, but if we have to recreate the DB we don't need to run 100 scripts to get there. Depending on how I'm deploying the DB changes, I'll also usually put a version table in the DB that holds the version of the DB. Then, rather than make any human decisions about which scripts to run, whatever code I have running the create/upgrade scripts uses the version to determine what to run. The one thing this will not do is help if part of what you're moving from test to production is data, but if you want to manage structure and not pay for a nice, but expensive DB management package, is really not very difficult. I've also found it's a pretty good way of keeping mental track of your DB. "}

You have to wait for the entire result set to be returned to your client process. You may eat up a lot of memory in your client to hold the built-up list. It may take a while for Python to construct and deconstruct the list which you are going to immediately discard anyways. If you know there's a single row being returned in the result set you can call fetchone() to get the single row. curs.execute('select max(x) from t') maxValue = curs.fetchone()[0] Finally, you can loop over the result set fetching one row at a time.

I'll use just Java terminology, because I am more au fait with that. As the answers mentioned, int is just a number (called the unboxed type), whereas Integer is an object (which contains the number, hence a boxed type). In Java terms, that means (apart from not being able to call methods on int), you cannot store int or other non-object types in collections (List, Map, etc.). In order to store them, you must first box them up in its corresponding boxed type. Java 5 onwards have something called auto-boxing and auto-unboxing which allow the boxing/unboxing to be done behind the scenes. Compare and contrast: Java 5 version: Deque<Integer> queue; void add(int n) { queue.add(n); } int remove() { return queue.remove(); } Java 1.4 or earlier (no generics either): Deque queue; void add(int n) { queue.add(Integer.valueOf(n)); } int remove() { return ((Integer) queue.remove()).intValue(); } It must be noted that despite the brevity in the Java 5 version, both versions generate identical bytecode. Thus, although auto-boxing and auto-unboxing is very convenient because you write less code, these operations do happen behind the scenes, with the same runtime costs, so you still have to be aware of their existence.

From Thomas Ptacek's blog: Speed is exactly what you don\u2019t want in a password hash function. Modern password schemes are attacked with incremental password crackers. Incremental crackers don\u2019t precalculate all possible cracked passwords. They consider each password hash individually, and they feed their dictionary through the password hash function the same way your PHP login page would. Rainbow table crackers like Ophcrack use space to attack passwords; incremental crackers like John the Ripper, Crack, and LC5 work with time: statistics and compute. The password attack game is scored in time taken to crack password X. With rainbow tables, that time depends on how big your table needs to be and how fast you can search it. With incremental crackers, the time depends on how fast you can make the password hash function run. The better you can optimize your password hash function, the faster your password hash function gets, the weaker your scheme is. MD5 and SHA1, even conventional block ciphers like DES, are designed to be fast. MD5, SHA1, and DES are weak password hashes. On modern CPUs, raw crypto building blocks like DES and MD5 can be bitsliced, vectorized, and parallelized to make password searches lightning fast. Game-over FPGA implementations cost only hundreds of dollars. "}

As for maintaining sessions over multiple servers. At that point it would be better to switch PHP to user handled sessions where it calls your provided functions to CRUD (create, read, update, delete) the session data. At that point you could store the session information in a database or memcache like solution so that all application servers have access to the data.

If you do not want to modify the schema to add triggers, (which makes a sense, it's not your database), have you considered working with the application vendor that does make the database? They could implement an API that provides a mechanism for notifying accessory apps that data has changed. It could be as simple as writing to a notification table that lists what table and which row were modified. That could be implemented through triggers or application code. From your side, ti wouldn't matter, your only concern would be scanning the notification table on a periodic basis. The performance hit on the database would be far less than scanning every row for changes. The hard part would be convincing the application vendor to implement this feature. Since this can be handles entirely through SQL via triggers, you could do the bulk of the work for them by writing and testing the triggers and then bringing the code to the application vendor.

And now a little off topic to tie this in to the list comprehension answer previously given (for a bit more clarity). List Comprehensions construct a list from a basic for loop with modifiers. As an example (to clarify slightly), a way to use the in dict language construct in a list comprehension: Say you have a two dimensional dictionary foo and you only want the second dimension dictionaries which contain the key bar. A relatively straightforward way to do so would be to use a list comprehension with a conditional as follows: #!/bin/python baz = dict([(key, value) for key, value in foo if bar in value]) Note the if bar in value at the end of the statement**, this is a modifying clause which tells the list comprehension to only keep those key-value pairs which meet the conditional.** In this case baz is a new dictionary which contains only the dictionaries from foo which contain bar (Hopefully I didn't miss anything in that code example... you may have to take a look at the list comprehension documentation found in docs.python.org tutorials and at secnetix.de, both sites are good references if you have questions in the future.).

I feel like I'm missing some simple insight that will reveal a much more efficient solution. My algorithm, in Haskell: matrixOfSums list = [[a+b | b <- list, b >= a] | a <- list] sortedSums = foldl merge [] matrixOfSums --A normal merge, save that we remove duplicates merge xs [] = xs merge [] ys = ys merge (x:xs) (y:ys) = case compare x y of LT -> x:(merge xs (y:ys)) EQ -> x:(merge xs (dropWhile (==x) ys)) GT -> y:(merge (x:xs) ys) I found a minor improvement, one that's more amenable to lazy stream-based coding. Instead of merging the columns pair-wise, merge all of them at once. The advantage being that you start getting elements of the list immediately. -- wide-merge does a standard merge (ala merge-sort) across an arbitrary number of lists -- wideNubMerge does this while eliminating duplicates wideNubMerge :: Ord a => [[a]] -> [a] wideNubMerge ls = wideNubMerge1 $ filter (/= []) ls wideNubMerge1 [] = [] wideNubMerge1 ls = mini:(wideNubMerge rest) where mini = minimum $ map head ls rest = map (dropWhile (== mini)) ls betterSortedSums = wideNubMerge matrixOfSums However, if you know you're going to use all of the sums, and there's no advantage to getting some of them earlier, go with 'foldl merge []', as it's faster.

The key difference is that it is decentralized. Imagine you are a developer on the road, you develop on your laptop and you want to have source control so that you can go back 3 hours. With Subversion, you have a Problem: The SVN Repository may be in a location you can't reach (in your company, and you don't have internet at the moment), you cannot commit. If you want to make a copy of your code, you have to literally copy/paste it. With Git, you do not have this problem. Your local copy is a repository, and you can commit to it and get all benefits of source control. When you regain connectivity to the main repository, you can commit against it. This looks good at first, but just keep in mind the added complexity to this approach. Git seems to be the \"new, shiny, cool\" thing. It's by no means bad (there is a reason Linus wrote it for the Linux Kernel development after all), but I feel that many people jump on the \"Distributed Source Control\" train just because it's new and is written by Linus Torvalds, without actually knowing why/if it's better. Subversion has Problems, but so does Git, Mercurial, CVS, TFS or whatever. Edit: So this answer is now a year old and still generates many upvotes, so I thought I'll add some more explanations. In the last year since writing this, Git has gained a lot of momentum and support, particularly since sites like GitHub really took off. I'm using both Git and Subversion nowadays and I'd like to share some personal insight. First of all, Git can be really confusing at first when working decentralized. What is a remote? and How to properly set up the initial repository? are two questions that come up at the beginning, especially compared to SVN's simple \"svnadmin create\", Git's \"git init\" can take the parameters --bare and --shared which seems to be the \"proper\" way to set up a centralized repository. There are reasons for this, but it adds complexity. The documentation of the \"checkout\" command is very confusing to people changing over - the \"proper\" way seems to be \"git clone\", while \"git checkout\" seems to switch branches. Git REALLY shines when you are decentralized. I have a server at home and a Laptop on the road, and SVN simply doesn't work well here. With SVN, I can't have local source control if I'm not connected to the repository (Yes, I know about SVK or about ways to copy the repo). With Git, that's the default mode anyway. It's an extra command though (git commit commits locally, whereas git push origin master pushes the master branch to the remote named \"origin\"). As said above: Git adds complexity. Two modes of creating repositories, checkout vs. clone, commit vs. push... You have to know which commands work locally and which work with \"the server\" (I'm assuming most people still like a central \"master-repository\"). Also, the tooling is still insufficient, at least on Windows. Yes, there is a Visual Studio AddIn, but I still use git bash with msysgit. SVN has the advantage that it's MUCH simpler to learn: There is your repository, all changes to towards it, if you know how to create, commit and checkout and you're ready to go and can pickup stuff like branching, update etc. later on. Git has the advantage that it's MUCH better suited if some developers are not always connected to the master repository. Also, it's much faster than SVN. And from what I hear, branching and merging support is a lot better (which is to be expected, as these are the core reasons it was written). This also explains why it gains so much buzz on the Internet, as Git is perfectly suited for Open Source projects: Just Fork it, commit your changes to your own Fork, and then ask the original project maintainer to pull your changes. With Git, this just works. Really, try it on Github, it's magic. What I also see are Git-SVN Bridges: The central repository is a Subversion repo, but developers locally work with Git and the bridge then pushes their changes to SVN. But even with this lengthy addition, I still stand by my core message: Git is not better or worse, it's just different. If you have the need for \"Offline Source Control\" and the willingness to spend some extra time learning it, it's fantastic. But if you have a strictly centralized Source Control and/or are struggling to introduce Source Control in the first place because your co-workers are not interested, then the simplicity and excellent tooling (at least on Windows) of SVN shine.

{"user":"34","questionId":"871","creationDate":"2008-08-03T22:47:42.703","answerId":"876","type":"answer","body":"Well, it's distributed. Benchmarks indicate that it's considerably faster (given its distributed nature, operations like diffs and logs are all local so of course it's blazingly faster in this case), and working folders are smaller (which still blows my mind). When you're working on subversion, or any other client/server revision control system, you essentially create working copies on your machine by checking-out revisions. This represents a snapshot in time of what the repository looks like. You update your working copy via updates, and you update the repository via commits. With a distributed version control, you don't have a snapshot, but rather the entire codebase. Wanna do a diff with a 3 month old version? No problem, the 3 month old version is still on your computer. This doesn't only mean things are way faster, but if you're disconnected from your central server, you can still do many of the operations you're used to. In other words, you don't just have a snapshot of a given revision, but the entire codebase. You'd think that Git would take up a bunch of space on your harddrive, but from a couple benchmarks I've seen, it actually takes less. Don't ask me how. I mean, it was built by Linus, he knows a thing or two about filesystems I guess. "}

In the end this should take O(n^2) time. step 2 (sumlist) create an empty list mergedlist for each list templist in sumlist set mergelist equal to: merge(mergedlist,templist) return mergedlist The merge method would be then the normal merge step with a check to make sure that there are no duplicate sums.

My own reasoning also makes me think DVCS makes things harder for QA and release management if you do things like centralized releases. Someone has to be responsible for doing that push/pull from everyone else's repository, resolving any conflicts that would have been resolved at initial commit time before, then doing the build, and then having all the other developers re-sync their repos. All of this can be addressed with human processes, of course; DVCS just broke something that was fixed by centralized version control in order to provide some new conveniences. "}

You can do this just as well with git as with SVN, but the benefits of git get outweighed by the need to do additional steps to synch with a central server. In SVN you just commit. In git you have to git commit, then git push. The additional step gets annoying simply because you end up doing it so much.

We basically had a file that had all translations in the .resx file, and then multiple files with different translations. The consequence of this is that you have to be very diligent about ensuring that all strings visible in the application are stored in the .resx, and anytime one is changed you have to update all languages you support. If you get lazy and don't notify the people in charge of translations, or you embed strings without going through your localization system, it will be a nightmare to try and fix it later. Similarly, if localization is an afterthought, it will be very difficult to put in place. Bottom line, if you don't have all visible strings stored externally in a standard place, it will be very difficult to find all that need to be localized. One other note, very strictly avoid concatenating visible strings directly, such as String message = \"The \" + item + \" is on sale!\"; Instead, you must use something like String message = String.Format(\"The {0} is on sale!\", item); The reason for this is that different languages often order the words differently, and concatenating strings directly will need a new build to fix, but if you used some kind of string replacement mechanism like above, you can modify your .resx file (or whatever localization files you use) for the specific language that needs to reorder the words.

I think I move this over to .net, as PHP's Unicode support is - in my opinion - not really good. Sure, juggling around with utf8_de/encode or the mbstring-functions is fun. Almost as fun as having Freddy Kr\u00fcger visit you at night... Realizing that some languages are a LOT more Verbose than others. German is a LOT more verbose than English usually, and seeing how the German Version destroys the User Interface because too little space was allocated was not fun. Some products gained some fame for their creative ways to work around that, with Oblivion's \"Schw.Tr.d.Le.En.W.\" being memorable :-) Playing around with date formats, woohoo! Yes, there ARE actually people in the world who use date formats where the day goes in the middle. Sooooo much fun trying to find out what 07/02/2008 is supposed to mean, just because some users might believe it could be July 2... But then again, you guys over the pond may believe the same about users who put the month in the middle :-P, especially because in English, July 2 sounds a lot better than 2nd of July, something that does not neccessarily apply to other languages (i.e. in German, you would never say Juli 2 but always Zweiter Juli). I use 2008-02-07 whenever possible. It's clear that it means February 7 and it sorts properly, but dd/mm vs. mm/dd can be a really tricky problem. Anoter fun thing, Number formats! 10.000,50 vs 10,000.50 vs. 10 000,50 vs. 10'000,50... This is my biggest nightmare right now, having to support a multi-cultural environent but not having any way to reliably know what number format the user will use. Formal or Informal. In some language, there are two ways to address people, a formal way and a more informal way. In English, you just say \"You\", but in German you have to decide between the formal \"Sie\" and the informal \"Du\", same for French Tu/Vous. It's usually a safe bet to choose the formal way, but this is easily overlooked. Calendars. In Europe, the first day of the Week is Monday, whereas in the US it's Sunday. Calendar Widgets are nice. Showing a Calendar with Sunday on the left and Saturday on the right to a European user is not so nice, it confuses them. "}

It does compile, and seems to work, though. Is this safe for SMP systems or SpeedStep? That's a good question... I think the code's ok. From a practical standpoint, we use it in my company every day, and we run on a pretty wide array of boxes, everything from 2-8 cores. Of course, YMMV, etc, but it seems to be a reliable and low-overhead (because it doesn't make a context switch into system-space) method of timing. Generally how it works is: declare the block of code to be assembler (and volatile, so the optimizer will leave it alone). execute the CPUID instruction. In addition to getting some CPU information (which we don't do anything with) it synchronizes the CPU's execution buffer so that the timings aren't affected by out-of-order execution. execute the rdtsc (read timestamp) execution. This fetches the number of machine cycles executed since the processor was reset. This is a 64-bit value, so with current CPU speeds it will wrap around every 194 years or so. Interestingly, in the original Pentium reference, they note it wraps around every 5800 years or so. the last couple of lines store the values from the registers into the variables hi and lo, and put that into the 64-bit return value. Specific notes: out-of-order execution can cause incorrect results, so we execute the \"cpuid\" instruction which in addition to giving you some information about the cpu also synchronizes any out-of-order instruction execution. Most OS's synchronize the counters on the CPUs when they start, so the answer is good to within a couple of nano-seconds. The hibernating comment is probably true, but in practice you probably don't care about timings across hibernation boundaries. regarding speedstep: Newer Intel CPUs compensate for the speed changes and returns an adjusted count. I did a quick scan over some of the boxes on our network and found only one box that didn't have it: a Pentium 3 running some old database server. (these are linux boxes, so I checked with: grep constant_tsc /proc/cpuinfo) I'm not sure about the AMD CPUs, we're primarily an Intel shop, although I know some of our low-level systems gurus did an AMD evaluation. Hope this satisfies your curiosity, it's an interesting and (IMHO) under-studied area of programming. You know when Jeff and Joel were talking about whether or not a programmer should know C? I was shouting at them, \"hey forget that high-level C stuff... assembler is what you should learn if you want to know what the computer is doing!\" "}

An escape string constant is specified by writing the letter E (upper or lower case) just before the opening single quote, e.g. E'foo'. (When continuing an escape string constant across lines, write E only before the first opening quote.) Within an escape string, a backslash character (\\) begins a C-like backslash escape sequence, in which the combination of backslash and following character(s) represents a special byte value. \\b is a backspace, \\f is a form feed, \\n is a newline, \\r is a carriage return, \\t is a tab. Also supported are \\digits, where digits represents an octal byte value, and \\xhexdigits, where hexdigits represents a hexadecimal byte value. (It is your responsibility that the byte sequences you create are valid characters in the server character set encoding.) Any other character following a backslash is taken literally. Thus, to include a backslash character, write two backslashes (\\\\). Also, a single quote can be included in an escape string by writing \\', in addition to the normal way of ''. "}

You've said you want to do this in C# so here goes... If you don't know which process has the file locked, you'll need to examine each process's handle list, and query each handle to determine if it identifies the locked file. Doing this in C# will likely require P/Invoke or an intermediary C++/CLI to call the native APIs you'll need. Once you've figured out which process(es) have the file locked, you'll need to safely inject a small native DLL into the process (you can also inject a managed DLL, but this is messier, as you then have to start or attach to the .NET runtime). That bootstrap DLL then closes the handle using CloseHandle etc. Essentially: the way to unlock a \"locked\" file is to inject a DLL into the offending process's address space and close it yourself. You can do this using native or managed code. No matter what, you're going to need a small amount of native code or at least P/Invoke into the same.

The usual tools to locate this corruption seem to be inapplicable. Old builds (18 months old) of the source code exhibit the same behaviour as the most recent release, so this has been around for a long time and just wasn't noticed; on the downside, source deltas can't be used to identify when the bug was introduced - there are a lot of code changes in the repository. The prompt for crashing behaviuor is to generate throughput in this system - socket transfer of data which is munged into an internal representation. I have a set of test data that will periodically cause the app to exception (various places, various causes - including heap alloc failing, thus: heap corruption). The behaviour seems related to CPU power or memory bandwidth; the more of each the machine has, the easier it is to crash. Disabling a hyper-threading core or a dual-core core reduces the rate of (but does not eliminate) corruption. This suggests a timing related issue. Now here's the rub: When it's run under a lightweight debug environment (say Visual Studio 98 / AKA MSVC6) the heap corruption is reasonably easy to reproduce - ten or fifteen minutes pass before something fails horrendously and exceptions, like an alloc; when running under a sophisticated debug environment (Rational Purify, VS2008/MSVC9 or even Microsoft Application Verifier) the system becomes memory-speed bound and doesn't crash (Memory-bound: CPU is not getting above 50%, disk light is not on, the program's going as fast it can, box consuming 1.3G of 2G of RAM). So, I've got a choice between being able to reproduce the problem (but not identify the cause) or being able to idenify the cause or a problem I can't reproduce. My current best guesses as to where to next is: Get an insanely grunty box (to replace the current dev box: 2Gb RAM in an E6550 Core2 Duo); this will make it possible to repro the crash causing mis-behaviour when running under a powerful debug environment; or Rewrite operators new and delete to use VirtualAlloc and VirtualProtect to mark memory as read-only as soon as it's done with. Run under MSVC6 and have the OS catch the bad-guy who's writing to freed memory. Yes, this is a sign of desperation: who the hell rewrites new and delete?! I wonder if this is going to make it as slow as under Purify et al. And, no: Shipping with Purify instrumentation built in is not an option. A colleague just walked past and asked \"Stack Overflow? Are we getting stack overflows now?!?\" And now, the question: How do I locate the heap corruptor? Update: balancing new[] and delete[] seems to have gotten a long way towards solving the problem. Instead of 15mins, the app now goes about two hours before crashing. Not there yet. Any further suggestions? The heap corruption persists. Update: a release build under Visual Studio 2008 seems dramatically better; current suspicion rests on the STL implementation that ships with VS98. Reproduce the problem. Dr Watson will produce a dump that might be helpful in further analysis. I'll take a note of that, but I'm concerned that Dr Watson will only be tripped up after the fact, not when the heap is getting stomped on. Another try might be using WinDebug as a debugging tool which is quite powerful being at the same time also lightweight. Got that going at the moment, again: not much help until something goes wrong. I want to catch the vandal in the act. Maybe these tools will allow you at least to narrow the problem to certain component. I don't hold much hope, but desperate times call for... And are you sure that all the components of the project have correct runtime library settings (C/C++ tab, Code Generation category in VS 6.0 project settings)?

What happened behind the scenes is this: The framework detected the exception, walked up the call stack to the very top, found no handlers that would recover from the error, so was unable to determine if it was safe to continue execution. So, it started the shutdown sequence, and fired up this event as a courtesy to you so you can pay your respects to your already-doomed process. This happens when an exception is left unhandled in the main thread. There is no single-point solution to this kind of error. You need to put a real exception handler (a catch block) upstream of all places where this error occurs and forward it to (for example) a global handler method/class that will determine if it is safe to simply report and continue, based on exception type and/or content. Edit: It is possible to disable (=hack) the error-reporting mechanism built into Windows so the mandatory \"crash and burn\" dialog does not get displayed when your app goes down. However, this becomes effective for all the applications in the system, not just your own. "}

{"user":"264","questionId":"1108","creationDate":"2008-08-04T10:41:04.620","answerId":"1130","type":"answer","body":"Why is it needed? When data is stored on disk based storage devices, it is stored as blocks of data. These blocks are accessed in their entirety, making them the atomic disk access operation. Disk blocks are structured in much the same way as linked lists; both contain a section for data, a pointer to the location of the next node (or block), and both need not be stored contiguously. Due to the fact that a number of records can only be sorted on one field, we can state that searching on a field that isn\u2019t sorted requires a Linear Search which requires N/2 block accesses (on average), where N is the number of blocks that the table spans. If that field is a non-key field (i.e. doesn\u2019t contain unique entries) then the entire table space must be searched at N block accesses. Whereas with a sorted field, a Binary Search may be used, this has log2 N block accesses. Also since the data is sorted given a non-key field, the rest of the table doesn\u2019t need to be searched for duplicate values, once a higher value is found. Thus the performance increase is substantial. What is indexing? Indexing is a way of sorting a number of records on multiple fields. Creating an index on a field in a table creates another data structure which holds the field value, and pointer to the record it relates to. This index structure is then sorted, allowing Binary Searches to be performed on it. The downside to indexing is that these indexes require additional space on the disk, since the indexes are stored together in a table using the MyISAM engine, this file can quickly reach the size limits of the underlying file system if many fields within the same table are indexed. How does it work? Firstly, let\u2019s outline a sample database table schema; Field name Data type Size on disk id (Primary key) Unsigned INT 4 bytes firstName Char(50) 50 bytes lastName Char(50) 50 bytes emailAddress Char(100) 100 bytes Note: char was used in place of varchar to allow for an accurate size on disk value. This sample database contains five million rows, and is unindexed. The performance of several queries will now be analyzed. These are a query using the id (a sorted key field) and one using the firstName (a non-key unsorted field). Example 1 - sorted vs unsorted fields Given our sample database of r = 5,000,000 records of a fixed size giving a record length of R = 204 bytes and they are stored in a table using the MyISAM engine which is using the default block size B = 1,024 bytes. The blocking factor of the table would be bfr = (B/R) = 1024/204 = 5 records per disk block. The total number of blocks required to hold the table is N = (r/bfr) = 5000000/5 = 1,000,000 blocks. A linear search on the id field would require an average of N/2 = 500,000 block accesses to find a value, given that the id field is a key field. But since the id field is also sorted, a binary search can be conducted requiring an average of log2 1000000 = 19.93 = 20 block accesses. Instantly we can see this is a drastic improvement. Now the firstName field is neither sorted nor a key field, so a binary search is impossible, nor are the values unique, and thus the table will require searching to the end for an exact N = 1,000,000 block accesses. It is this situation that indexing aims to correct. Given that an index record contains only the indexed field and a pointer to the original record, it stands to reason that it will be smaller than the multi-field record that it points to. So the index itself requires fewer disk blocks than the original table, which therefore requires fewer block accesses to iterate through. The schema for an index on the firstName field is outlined below; Field name Data type Size on disk firstName Char(50) 50 bytes (record pointer) Special 4 bytes Note: Pointers in MySQL are 2, 3, 4 or 5 bytes in length depending on the size of the table. Example 2 - indexing Given our sample database of r = 5,000,000 records with an index record length of R = 54 bytes and using the default block size B = 1,024 bytes. The blocking factor of the index would be bfr = (B/R) = 1024/54 = 18 records per disk block. The total number of blocks required to hold the index is N = (r/bfr) = 5000000/18 = 277,778 blocks. Now a search using the firstName field can utilise the index to increase performance. This allows for a binary search of the index with an average of log2 277778 = 18.08 = 19 block accesses. To find the address of the actual record, which requires a further block access to read, bringing the total to 19 + 1 = 20 block accesses, a far cry from the 1,000,000 block accesses required to find a firstName match in the non-indexed table. When should it be used? Given that creating an index requires additional disk space (277,778 blocks extra from the above example, a ~28% increase), and that too many indexes can cause issues arising from the file systems size limits, careful thought must be used to select the correct fields to index. Since indexes are only used to speed up the searching for a matching field within the records, it stands to reason that indexing fields used only for output would be simply a waste of disk space and processing time when doing an insert or delete operation, and thus should be avoided. Also given the nature of a binary search, the cardinality or uniqueness of the data is important. Indexing on a field with a cardinality of 2 would split the data in half, whereas a cardinality of 1,000 would return approximately 1,000 records. With such a low cardinality the effectiveness is reduced to a linear sort, and the query optimizer will avoid using the index if the cardinality is less than 30% of the record number, effectively making the index a waste of space.

Then, Microsoft decided that WinHelp was not hip and cool anymore and switched to CHM, up to the point they actually axed WinHelp from Vista. Now, CHM maybe nice, but everyone that tried to open a .chm file on the Network will know the nice \"Navigation to the webpage was canceled\" screen that is caused by security restrictions. While there are ways to make CHM work off the network, this is hardly a good choice, because when a user presses the Help Button he wants help and not have to make some funky settings. Bottom Line: I find CHM absolutely unusable. But with WinHelp not being an option anymore either, I wonder what the alternatives are, especially when it comes to integrate with my Application (i.e. for WinHelp and CHM there are functions that allow you to directly jump to a topic)? PDF has the disadvantage of requiring the Adobe Reader (or one of the more lightweight ones that not many people use). I could live with that seeing as this is kind of standard nowadays, but can you tell it reliably to jump to a given page/anchor? HTML files seem to be the best choice, you then just have to deal with different browsers (CSS and stuff). Edit: I am looking to create my own Help Files. As I am a fan of the \"No Setup, Just Extract and Run\" Philosophy, i had that problem many times in the past because many of my users will run it off the network, which causes exactly this problem. So i am looking for a more robust and future-proof way to provide help to my users without having to code a different help system for each application i make. CHM is a really nice format, but that Security Stuff makes it unusable, as a Help system is supposed to provide help to the user, not to generate even more problems. "}

Well, though it has been a while since I used C/C++, realloc that grows only reuses the memory pointer value if there is room in memory after your original block. For instance, consider this: (xxxxxxxxxx..........) If your pointer points to the first x, and . means free memory location, and you grow the memory size pointed to by your variable by 5 bytes, it'll succeed. This is of course a simplified example as blocks are rounded up to a certain size for alignment, but anyway. However, if you subsequently try to grow it by another 10 bytes, and there is only 5 available, it will need to move the block in memory and update your pointer. However, in your example you are passing the function a pointer to the character, not a pointer to your variable, and thus while the strrep function internally might be able to adjust the variable in use, it is a local variable to the strrep function and your calling code will be left with the original pointer variable value. This pointer value, however, has been freed. In your case, input is the culprit. However, I would make another suggestion. In your case it looks like the input variable is indeed input, and if it is, it shouldn't be modified, at all. I would thus try to find another way to do what you want to do, without changing input, as side-effects like this can be hard to track down. "}

I'd say that what \"efficient\" means depends on a lot of things, like: speed of updates (insert, update, delete) speed of random access retrieval speed of sequential retrieval memory used I think that you'll find that a data structure that is speedy will generally consume more memory than one that is slow. This isn't always the case, but most data structures seems to follow this. A dictionary might be easy to use, and give you relatively uniformly fast access, it will most likely use more memory than, as you suggest, lists. Lists, however, generally tend to contain more overhead when you insert data into it, unless they preallocate X nodes, in which they will again use more memory. My suggestion, in general, would be to just use the method that seems the most natural to you, and then do a \"stress test\" of the system, adding a substantial amount of data to it and see if it becomes a problem.

The downside with using signed numbers is that there's a temptation to overload them so that, for example, the values 0->n are the menu selection, and -1 means nothing's selected - rather than creating a class that has two variables, one to indicate if something is selected and another to store what that selection is. Before you know it, you're testing for negative one all over the place and the compiler is complaining about how you're wanting to compare the menu selection against the number of menu selections you have - but that's dangerous because they're different types.

Correct: int is an alias for System.Int32. Wrong: float is not an alias for System.Float, but for System.Single Basically, int is a reserved keyword in the C# programming language, and is an alias for the System.Int32 value type. float and Float is not the same however, as the right system type for ''float'' is System.Single. There are some types like this that has reserved keywords that doesn't seem to match the type names directly. In C# there is no difference between ''int'' and ''System.Int32'', or any of the other pairs or keywords/system types, except for when defining enums. With enums you can specify the storage size to use and in this case you can only use the reserved keyword, and not the system runtime type name. Wether the value in the int will be stored on the stack, in memory, or as a referenced heap object depends on the context and how you use it. This declaration in a method: int i; defines a variable i of type System.Int32, living in a register or on the stack, depending on optimizations. The same declaration in a type (struct or class) defines a member field. The same declaration in a method argument list defines a parameter, with the same storage options as for a local variable. (note that this paragraph is not valid if you start pulling iterator methods into the mix, these are different beasts altogether) To get a heap object, you can use boxing: object o = i; this will create a boxed copy of the contents of i on the heap. In IL you can access methods on the heap object directly, but in C# you need to cast it back to an int, which will create another copy. Thus, the object on the heap cannot easily be changed in C# without creating a new boxed copy of a new int value. (Ugh, this paragraph doesn't read all that easily.) "}

There are quantization algorithms for this, like the Adaptive Spatial Subdivision algorithm used by ImageMagic. These algorithms usually don't just pick existing colors from the source space but creates new colors in the target space that most closely resemble the source colors. As a simplified example, if you have 3 colors in the original image where two are red (with different intensity or bluish tints etc.) and the third is blue, and need to reduce to two colors, the target image could have a red color that is some kind of average of the original two red + the blue color from the original image.

See HSL, HSV on Wikipedia. I suppose naively I would plot the points in the HSL space for the two colours and calculate the magnitude of the difference vector. However this would mean that bright yellow and bright green would be considered just as different as green to dark green. But then many consider red and pink two different colours. Moreover, difference vectors in the same direction in this parameter space are not equal. For instance, the human eye picks up green much better than other colours. A shift in hue from green by the same amount as a shift from red may seem greater. Also a shift in saturation from a small amount to zero is the difference between grey and pink, elsewhere the shift would be the difference between two shades of red. From a programmers point of view, you would need to plot the difference vectors but modified by a proportionality matrix that would adjust the lengths accordingly in various regions of the HSL space - this would be fairly arbitrary and would be based on various colour theory ideas but be tweaked fairly arbitrarily depending on what you wanted to apply this to. Even better, you could see if anyone has already done such a thing online... "}

If you inverse the requirements, path of maximum resistance, it could perhaps be used to produce a set that from the start produces maximum difference as you go, and towards the end starts to go back to values closer to the others. For instance, here's one way to perhaps do what you want. Calculate the distance (ref your other post) from each color to all other colors Sum the distances for each color, this gives you an indication for how far away this color is from all other colors in total Order the list by distance, going down This would, it seems, produce a list that starts with the color that is farthest away from all other colors, and then go down, colors towards the end of the list would be closer to other colors in general. Edit: Reading your reply to my first post, about the spatial subdivision, would not exactly fit the above description, since colors close to other colors would fall to the bottom of the list, but let's say you have a cluster of colors somewhere, at least one of the colors from that cluster would be located near the start of the list, and it would be the one that generally was farthest away from all other colors in total.

{"user":"266","questionId":"1383","creationDate":"2008-08-04T16:36:51.750","answerId":"1393","type":"answer","body":"Unit testing is, roughly speaking, testing bits of your code in isolation with test code. The immediate advantages that come to mind are: Running the tests becomes automate-able and repeatable You can test at a much more granular level than point-and-click testing via a GUI Note that if your test code writes to a file, opens a database connection or does something over the network, it's more appropriately categorized as an integration test. Integration tests are a good thing, but should not be confused with unit tests. Unit test code should be short, sweet and quick to execute. Another way to look at unit testing is that you write the tests first. This is known as Test-Driven Development (TDD for short). TDD brings additional advantages: You don't write speculative \"I might need this in the future\" code -- just enough to make the tests pass The code you've written is always covered by tests By writing the test first, you're forced into thinking about how you want to call the code, which usually improves the design of the code in the long run. If you're not doing unit testing now, I recommend you get started on it. Get a good book, practically any xUnit-book will do because the concepts are very much transferable between them. Sometimes writing unit tests can be painful. When it gets that way, try to find someone to help you, and resist the temptation to \"just write the damn code\". Unit testing is a lot like washing the dishes. It's not always pleasant, but it keeps your metaphorical kitchen clean, and you really want it to be clean. :) Edit: One misconception comes to mind, although I'm not sure if it's so common. I've heard a project manager say that unit tests made the team write all the code twice. If it looks and feels that way, well, you're doing it wrong. Not only does writing the tests usually speed up development, but it also gives you a convenient \"now I'm done\" indicator that you wouldn't have otherwise. "}

Unit testing is the process of writing code to test the behavior and functionality of your system. Obviously tests improve the quality of your code, but that's just a superficial benefit of unit testing. The real benefits are to: Make it easier to change the technical implementation while making sure you don't change the behavior (refactoring). Properly unit tested code can be aggressively refactored/cleaned up with little chance of breaking anything without noticing it. Give developers confidence when adding behavior or making fixes. Document your code Indicate areas of your code that are tightly coupled. It's hard to unit test code that's tightly coupled Provide a means to use your API and look for difficulties early on Indicates methods and classes that aren't very cohesive You should unit test because its in your interest to deliver a maintainable and quality product to your client. I'd suggest you use it for any system, or part of a system, which models real-world behavior. In other words, it's particularly well suited for enterprise development. I would not use it for throw-away/utility programs. I would not use it for parts of a system that are problematic to test (UI is a common example, but that isn't always the case) The greatest pitfall is that developers test too large a unit, or they consider a method a unit. This is particularly true if you don't understand Inversion of Control - in which case your unit tests will always turn into end-to-end integration testing. Unit test should test individual behaviors - and most methods have many behaviors. The greatest misconception is that programmers shouldn't test. Only bad or lazy programmers believe that. Should the guy building your roof not test it? Should the doctor replacing a heart valve not test the new valve? Only a programmer can test that his code does what he intended it to do (QA can test edge cases - how code behaves when it's told to do things the programmer didn't intend, and the client can do acceptance test - does the code do what what the client paid for it to do) "}

Character Sets Unicode is great, but you can't get away with ignoring other character sets. The default character set on Windows XP (English) is Cp1252. On the web, you don't know what a browser will send you (though hopefully your container will handle most of this). And don't be surprised when there are bugs in whatever implementation you are using. Character sets can have interesting interactions with filenames when they move to between machines. Translating Strings Translators are, generally speaking, not coders. If you send a source file to a translator, they will break it. Strings should be extracted to resource files (e.g. properties files in Java or resource DLLs in Visual C++). Translators should be given files that are difficult to break and tools that don't let them break them. Translators do not know where strings come from in a product. It is difficult to translate a string without context. If you do not provide guidance, the quality of the translation will suffer. While on the subject of context, you may see the same string \"foo\" crop up in multiple times and think it would be more efficient to have all instances in the UI point to the same resource. This is a bad idea. Words may be very context-sensitive in some languages. Translating strings costs money. If you release a new version of a product, it makes sense to recover the old versions. Have tools to recover strings from your old resource files. String concatenation and manual manipulation of strings should be minimized. Use the format functions where applicable. Translators need to be able to modify hotkeys. Ctrl+P is print in English; the Germans use Ctrl+D. If you have a translation process that requires someone to manually cut and paste strings at any time, you are asking for trouble. Dates, Times, Calendars, Currency, Number Formats, Time Zones These can all vary from country to country. A comma may be used to denote decimal places. Times may be in 24hour notation. Not everyone uses the Gregorian calendar. You need to be unambiguous, too. If you take care to display dates as MM/DD/YYYY for the USA and DD/MM/YYYY for the UK on your website, the dates are ambiguous unless the user knows you've done it. Especially Currency The Locale functions provided in the class libraries will give you the local currency symbol, but you can't just stick a pound (sterling) or euro symbol in front of a value that gives a price in dollars. User Interfaces Layout should be dynamic. Not only are strings likely to double in length on translation, the entire UI may need to be inverted (Hebrew; Arabic) so that the controls run from right to left. And that is before we get to Asia. Testing Prior To Translation Use static analysis of your code to locate problems. At a bare minimum, leverage the tools built into your IDE. (Eclipse users can go to Window > Preferences > Java > Compiler > Errors/Warnings and check for non-externalised strings.) Smoke test by simulating translation. It isn't difficult to parse a resource file and replace strings with a pseudo-translated version that doubles the length and inserts funky characters. You don't have to speak a language to use a foreign operating system. Modern systems should let you log in as a foreign user with translated strings and foreign locale. If you are familiar with your OS, you can figure out what does what without knowing a single word of the language. Keyboard maps and character set references are very useful. Virtualisation would be very useful here. Non-technical Issues Sometimes you have to be sensitive to cultural differences (offence or incomprehension may result). A mistake you often see is the use of flags as a visual cue choosing a website language or geography. Unless you want your software to declare sides in global politics, this is a bad idea. If you were French and offered the option for English with St. George's flag (the flag of England is a red cross on a white field), this might result in confusion for many English speakers - assume similar issues will arise with foreign languages and countries. Icons need to be vetted for cultural relevance. What does a thumbs-up or a green tick mean? Language should be relatively neutral - addressing users in a particular manner may be acceptable in one region, but considered rude in another.

For example, if a user can view & edit users, the binary result of the operation is 0000 0011 which converted to decimal is 3. You can then store the permission of one user into a single column of your DataBase (in our case it would be 3). Inside your application, you just need another bitwise operation (OR) to verify if a user has a particular permission or not. "}

If the indexes of your tables fit into memory and your queries are highly optimized, you can serve a reasonable amount of requests with a average machine. The number of records do matter, depending of how your tables look like. It's a difference to have a lot of varchar fields or only a couple of ints or longs. The physical size of the database matters as well: think of backups, for instance. Depending on your engine, your physical db files on grow, but don't shrink, for instance with innodb.

Anyway, here's the problem: Let's say you have some class which wraps or includes networked file IO operations (e.g. reading and writing to some file at some particular UNC path somewhere). For various reasons you don't want those IO operations to fail, so if you detect that they fail you retry them and you keep retrying them until they succeed or you reach a timeout. I already have a convenient RetryTimer class which I can instantiate and use to sleep the current thread between retries and determine when the timeout period has elapsed, etc. The problem is that you have a bunch of IO operations in several methods of this class, and you need to wrap each of them in try-catch / retry logic. Here's an example code snippet: RetryTimer fileIORetryTimer = new RetryTimer(TimeSpan.FromHours(10)); bool success = false; while (!success) { try { // do some file IO which may succeed or fail success = true; } catch (IOException e) { if (fileIORetryTimer.HasExceededRetryTimeout) { throw e; } fileIORetryTimer.SleepUntilNextRetry(); } } So, how do you avoid duplicating most of this code for every file IO operation throughout the class? My solution was to use anonymous delegate blocks and a single method in the class which executed the delegate block passed to it. This allowed me to do things like this in other methods: this.RetryFileIO( delegate() { // some code block } ); I like this somewhat, but it leaves a lot to be desired. I'd like to hear how other people would solve this sort of problem. "}

Thus: public class MyClass : BaseClass { // Your stuff here } Becomes: public class MyClass { private BaseClass baseClass; public void ExposeThisMethod() { baseClass.ExposeThisMethod(); } } Or: public class MyClass { private BaseClass baseClass; public BaseClass BaseClass { get { return baseClass; } } } "}

{"user":"216","questionId":"1607","creationDate":"2008-08-04T22:45:11.443","answerId":"1666","type":"answer","body":"In the Rails world, there's the concept of migrations, scripts in which changes to the database are made in Ruby rather than a database-specific flavour of SQL. Your Ruby migration code ends up being converted into the DDL specific to your current database; this makes switching database platforms very easy. For every change you make to the database, you write a new migration. Migrations typically have two methods: an \"up\" method in which the changes are applied and a \"down\" method in which the changes are undone. A single command brings the database up to date, and can also be used to bring the database to a specific version of the schema. In Rails, migrations are kept in their own directory in the project directory and get checked into version control just like any other project code. This Oracle guide to Rails migrations covers migrations quite well. Developers using other languages have looked at migrations and have implemented their own language-specific versions. I know of Ruckusing, a PHP migrations system that is modelled after Rails' migrations; it might be what you're looking for. "}

It doesn't cover more practical parsing methods (opting for non-predictive recursive descent without discussing LL or LR parsing), and as I recall, it doesn't even discuss any sort of optimization theory. Plus, instead of compiling to machine code, it compiles to a bytecode that is supposed to run on a VM that you also write. It's still a decent read, particularly if you can pick it up for cheap on Amazon. If you only want an easy introduction into compilers, Game Scripting Mastery is not a bad way to go.

To my knowledge, Profiles are essentially a long string that gets split at the given field sizes, which means that they do not scale very well if you have many fields and users. On the other hand, they are built in, so it's an easy and standardized way, which means there is not a big learning curve and you can use it in future apps as well without needing to tweak it to a new table structure. Rolling your own thing allows you to put it in a properly normalized database, which drastically improves performance, but you have to write pretty much all the profile managing code yourself. Edit: Also, Profiles are not cached, so every access to a profile goes to the database first (it's then cached for that request, but the next request will get it from the database again) If you're thinking about writing your own thing, maybe a custom Profile Provider gives you the best of both worlds - seamless integration, yet the custom stuff you want to do.

Because you use tools like ANTLR and LLVM, it's feasible to write the entire compiler in a single day (I have an existence proof of this, though I do mean ~24 hours). It's heavy on practical engineering using modern tools, a bit lighter on theory. LLVM, by the way, is simply fantastic. Many situations where you might normally compile down to assembly, you'd be much better off compiling to LLVM's Intermediate Representation instead. It's higher level, cross platform, and LLVM is quite good at generating optimized assembly from it. "}

I'm working from a fairly rusty memory of a statistics course, but here goes nothing: When you're doing analysis of variance (ANOVA), you actually calculate the F statistic as the ratio from the mean-square variances \"between the groups\" and the mean-square variances \"within the groups\". The second link above seems pretty good for this calculation. This makes the F statistic measure exactly how powerful your model is, because the \"between the groups\" variance is explanatory power, and \"within the groups\" variance is random error. High F implies a highly significant model. As in many statistical operations, you back-determine Sig. using the F statistic. Here's where your Wikipedia information comes in slightly handy. What you want to do is - using the degrees of freedom given to you by SPSS - find the proper P value at which an F table will give you the F statistic you calculated. The P value where this happens [F(table) = F(calculated)] is the significance. Conceptually, a lower significance value shows a very strong ability to reject the null hypothesis (which for these purposes means to determine your model has explanatory power). Sorry to any math folks if any of this is wrong. I'll be checking back to make edits!!! Good luck to you. Stats is fun, just maybe not this part. =) "}

The users upload documents through a front-end application that is on the web. This application calls a web service of the back-end application and passes the document to it. The back-end app saves the document and inserts a row in the Document table. The document type (7 possible document types: Invoice, Contract etc.) is passed as a parameter to the web service's UploadDocument method. The question is, what should the type (and possible values) of this parameter be? Since you need to hardcode these values in both applications, I think it is O.K. to use a descriptive string (Invoice, Contract, WorkOrder, SignedWorkOrder). Is it maybe a better approach to create a DocumentTypes enumeration in the first application, and to reproduce it also in the second application, and then pass the corresponding integer value to the web service between them?

{"user":"137","questionId":"1383","creationDate":"2008-08-04T23:53:16.440","answerId":"1718","type":"answer","body":"This is my take on it. I would say unit testing is the practice of writing software tests to verify that your real software does what it is meant to. This started with jUnit in the Java world and has become a best practice in PHP as well with SimpleTest and phpUnit. It's a core practice of Extreme Programming and helps you to be sure that your software still works as intended after editing. If you have sufficient test coverage, you can do major refactoring, bug fixing or add features rapidly with much less fear of introducing other problems. It's most effective when all unit tests can be run automatically. Unit testing is generally associated with OO development. The basic idea is to create a script which sets up the environment for your code and then exercises it; you write assertions, specify the intended output that you should receive and then execute your test script using a framework such as those mentioned above. The framework will run all the tests against your code and then report back success or failure of each test. phpUnit is run from the Linux command line by default, though there are HTTP interfaces available for it. SimpleTest is web-based by nature and is much easier to get up and running, IMO. In combination with xDebug, phpUnit can give you automated statistics for code coverage which some people find very useful. Some teams write hooks from their subversion repository so that unit tests are run automatically whenever you commit changes. It's good practice to keep your unit tests in the same repository as your application. "}

Your weights could be the squared inverse of the x/y distance from your new point to each of your existing points. Some pseudocode: estimate-latitude-longitude (x, y) numerator-latitude := 0 numerator-longitude := 0 denominator := 0 for each point, deltaX := x - point.x deltaY := y - point.y distSq := deltaX * deltaX + deltaY * deltaY weight := 1 / distSq numerator-latitude += weight * point.latitude numerator-longitude += weight * point.longitude denominator += weight return (numerator-latitude / denominator, numerator-longitude / denominator) This code will give a relatively simple approximation.

My question is: I am setting up a project that uses a large database where all tables are interconnected in some way through Foreign Keys. My first inclination is to make one huge DataContext class that models the entire database. That way I could in theory (though I don't know if this would be needed in practice) use the Foreign Key connections that are generated through LinqToSql to easily go between related objects in my code, insert related objects, etc. However, after giving it some thought, I am now thinking that it may make more sense to create multiple DataContext classes, each one relating to a specific namespace or logical interrelated section within my database. My main concern is that instantiating and disposing one huge DataContext class all the time for individual operations that relate to specific areas of the Database would be impose an unnecessary imposition on application resources. Additionally, it is easier to create and manage smaller DataContext files than one big one. The thing that I would lose is that there would be some distant sections of the database that would not be navigable through LinqToSql (even though a chain of relationships connects them in the actual database). Additionally, there would be some table classes that would exist in more than one DataContext.

(for example a language like c++ allows the developer to pass a parameter by reference using '&' after the parameter's type) now the tricky part, or at least the part that will confuse most of the new java developers: (borrowed from javaworld) Original author: Tony Sintes public void tricky(Point arg1, Point arg2) { arg1.x = 100; arg1.y = 100; Point temp = arg1; arg1 = arg2; arg2 = temp; } public static void main(String [] args) { Point pnt1 = new Point(0,0); Point pnt2 = new Point(0,0); System.out.println(\"X: \" + pnt1.x + \" Y: \" +pnt1.y); System.out.println(\"X: \" + pnt2.x + \" Y: \" +pnt2.y); System.out.println(\" \"); tricky(pnt1,pnt2); System.out.println(\"X: \" + pnt1.x + \" Y:\" + pnt1.y); System.out.println(\"X: \" + pnt2.x + \" Y: \" +pnt2.y); } \"Output X: 0 Y: 0 X: 0 Y: 0 X: 100 Y: 100 X: 0 Y: 0\" tricky successfully changes the value of pnt1! This would imply that Objects are passed by reference, this is not the case! A correct statement would be: the Object references are passed by value. more from Tony Sintes: The method successfully alters the value of pnt1, even though it is passed by value; however, a swap of pnt1 and pnt2 fails! This is the major source of confusion. In the main() method, pnt1 and pnt2 are nothing more than object references. When you pass pnt1 and pnt2 to the tricky() method, Java passes the references by value just like any other parameter. This means the references passed to the method are actually copies of the original references. Figure 1 below shows two references pointing to the same object after Java passes an object to a method. figure 1 http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/javaqa/2000-05/images/03-qa-0512-pass2b.gif Conclusion or a long story short: Java passes it parameters by value \"by value\" is the only way in java to pass a parameter to a method using methods from the object given as parameter will alter the object as the references point to the original objects.

In some cases the model can also be used to turn a data source into a higher level abstraction as well. A good example of this is the MVC Storefront project. There is a discussion here regarding the differences between MVC vs MVP. The distinction made is that in an MVC application traditionally has the view and the controller interact with the model, but not with each other. MVP designs have the Presenter access the model and interact with the view. Having said that, ASP.NET MVC is by these definitions an MVP framework because the Controller accesses the Model to populate the View which is meant to have no logic (just displays the variables provided by the Controller). To perhaps get an idea of the ASP.NET MVC distinction from MVP, check out this MIX presentation by Scott Hanselman. "}

The presenter is responsible for binding the model to the view. Easier to unit test because interaction with the view is through an interface Usually view to presenter map one to one. Complex views may have multi presenters. MVC Pattern Controller are based on behaviors and can be shared across views Can be responsible for determining which view to display It is the best explanation on the web I could find. "}

The getPreferredSize method also needs to be managed in order to dynamically support changes to the content. Care needs to be taken when measuring font metrics and image dimensions. For creating a control that you can rely on, the above code is not the correct approach. Dimensions and colours are dynamic in Swing and are dependent on the look and feel being used. Even the default Metal look has changed across JRE versions. It would be better to implement AbstractButton and conform to the guidelines set out by the Swing API. A good starting point is to look at the javax.swing.LookAndFeel and javax.swing.UIManager classes. http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/swing/LookAndFeel.html http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/swing/UIManager.html Understanding the anatomy of LookAndFeel is useful for writing controls: Creating a Custom Look and Feel "}

The benefit of extending Swing components, of course, is to have the ability to add support for keyboard shortcuts and other accessibility features that you can't do just by having a paint() method print a pretty picture. It may not be done the best way however, but it may be a good starting point for you. Edit 8/6 - If it wasn't apparent from the images, each Die is a button you can click. This will move it to the DiceContainer below. Looking at the source code you can see that each Die button is drawn dynamically, based on its value. Here are the basic steps: Create a class that extends JComponent Call parent constructor super() in your constructors Make sure you class implements MouseListener Put this in the constructor: enableInputMethods(true); addMouseListener(this); Override these methods: public Dimension getPreferredSize() public Dimension getMinimumSize() public Dimension getMaximumSize() Override this method: public void paintComponent(Graphics g) The amount of space you have to work with when drawing your button is defined by getPreferredSize(), assuming getMinimumSize() and getMaximumSize() return the same value.

For example, a Cartesian coordinate is appropriately represented as a tuple of two or three numbers. Lists, on the other hand, are more like arrays in other languages. They tend to hold a varying number of objects all of which have the same type and which are operated on one-by-one. Generally by convention you wouldn't choose a list or a tuple just based on its (im)mutability. You would choose a tuple for small collections of completely different pieces of data in which a full-blown class would be too heavyweight, and a list for collections of any reasonable size where you have a homogeneous set of data.

Branching and tagging are effectively the same. Just copy a whole folder in the repository to somewhere else in the repository using the svn copy command. Basically this means that it is by convention what copying a folder means - whether it be a backup, tag, branch or whater. Depending upon how you want to think about things (normally depending upon which SCM tool you have used in the past) you need to set up a folder structure within your repository to support your style. Common styles are to have a bunch of folders at the top of your repository called tags, branches, trunk, etc. - that allows you to copy your whole trunk (or sub-sets) into the tags and/or branches folders. If you have more than one project you might want to replicate this kind of structure under each project: It can take a while to get used to the concept - but it works - just make sure you (and your team) are clear on the conventions that you are going to use. It is also a good idea to have a good naming convention - something that tells you why the branch/tag was made and whether it is still appropriate - consider ways of archiving branches that are obsolete.

Short version: I need some way to update the page ViewState after an async callback has been made, to reflect any state changes the server made during the async call. This seems to be a common problem, but I will describe my scenario to help explain: I have a grid-like control which has some JavaScript enhancements - namely, the ability to drag and drop columns and rows. When a column or row is dropped into a new position, an AJAX method is invoked to notify the control server-side and fire a corresponding server-side event (\"OnColumnMoved\" or \"OnRowMoved\"). ASP.NET AJAX calls, by default, send the entire page as the request. That way the page goes through a complete lifecycle, viewstate is persisted and the state of the control is restored before the RaiseCallbackEvent method is invoked. However, since the AJAX call does not update the page, the ViewState reflects the original state of the control, even after the column or row has been moved. So the second time a client-side action occurs, the AJAX request goes to the server and the page & control are built back up again to reflect the first state of the control, not the state after the first column or row was moved. This problem extends to many implications. For example if we have a client-side/AJAX action to add a new item to the grid, and then a row is dragged, the grid is built server-side with one less item than on the client-side. And finally & most seriously for my specific example, the actual data source object we are acting upon is stored in the page ViewState. That was a design decision to allow keeping a stateful copy of the manipulated data which can either be committed to DB after many manipulations or discarded if the user backs out. That is very difficult to change. So, again, I need a way for the page ViewState to be updated on callback after the AJAX method is fired. "}

It would be helpful to know the pros, cons, obstacles to introducing unit testing, flaws in the unit testing process, value gained by unit testing, and so on that the developers here have observed in their day to day practice. What we're doing: I work on a web application w/ an Oracle backend. The application has been in production for 8+ years, and there are ongoing enhancement efforts along with the maintenance work. My development team does Unit Test Scripts (UTS) that aim to walk a developer through the unit test of a given code package. These UTS are 2-20 page Word documents that describe the purpose of the package, the structure, and elaborate on given modules within a package. The UTS concludes with a section that describes an Application Test of the package. This doesn't sound like unit testing to me. It sounds a lot more like system integration testing w/ a description of the package. It certainly is not automated. With our UTS practice in its current state, managing/editing/follwing the documents is not a trivial task. And when enhancements or maintenance work to a given package is needed, there are not strict testing procedures put in place to guarantee outputs are satisfactory. Instead, we have this higher level UTS to follow, which does not come close to guaranteeing correct output in various code traces. "}

I have been in the situation where I must write unit tests for several years now, and I totally see the advantage for a clean and efficient development cycle, however these are some of the issues I have faced. Development may be clean, but when requirements change, you often have to start again at the unit test level. This is, of course, a process issue rather than a TDD one. Testing GUI stuff is nigh on impossible OOTB with most tools There is a large amount of self-discipline required to make sure you use best practice. It is unfortunate but it's very easy to fall away from test-driven to \"test-supported\" development. By that I mean starting off with the best of intentions, but not sticking to the idea of writing your test first. In all, though, I am in favour of using unit testing to improve stability, reliability, brevity and general quality of your code.

If you want to improve the script, feel free to update it at the link. First, note that when Ruby calls out to a shell, it typically calls /bin/sh, not Bash. Some Bash syntax is not supported by /bin/sh on all systems. Here are ways to execute a shell script: cmd = \"echo 'hi'\" # Sample string that can be used Kernel#` , commonly called backticks \u2013 `cmd` This is like many other languages, including Bash, PHP, and Perl. Returns the result of the shell command. Docs: http://ruby-doc.org/core/Kernel.html#method-i-60 value = `echo 'hi'` value = `#{cmd}` Built-in syntax, %x( cmd ) Following the x character is a delimiter, which can be any character. If the delimiter is one of the characters (, [, {, or <, the literal consists of the characters up to the matching closing delimiter, taking account of nested delimiter pairs. For all other delimiters, the literal comprises the characters up to the next occurrence of the delimiter character. String interpolation #{ ... } is allowed. Returns the result of the shell command, just like the backticks. Docs: http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/language.html value = %x( echo 'hi' ) value = %x[ #{cmd} ] Kernel#system Executes the given command in a subshell. Returns true if the command was found and ran successfully, false otherwise. Docs: http://ruby-doc.org/core/Kernel.html#method-i-system wasGood = system( \"echo 'hi'\" ) wasGood = system( cmd ) Kernel#exec Replaces the current process by running the given external command. Returns none, the current process is replaced and never continues. Docs: http://ruby-doc.org/core/Kernel.html#method-i-exec exec( \"echo 'hi'\" ) exec( cmd ) # Note: this will never be reached because of the line above Here's some extra advice: $?, which is the same as $CHILD_STATUS, accesses the status of the last system executed command if you use the backticks, system() or %x{}.

Other differences include: You can't use the 'as' operator to cast to a type that doesn't accept 'null' as a value You can't use 'as' to convert things, like numbers to a different representation (float to int, for example). And finally, using 'as' vs. the cast operator, you're also saying \"I'm not sure if this will succeed.\" "}

From a theoretical point of view, given that the distortion is \"arbitrary\", and any solution requires you to model this arbitrary distortion, you obviously can't get an \"answer\". However, any solution is going to involve imposing (usually implicitly) some model of the distortion that may or may not reflect the reality of the situation. Since you seem to be most interested in models that presume some sort of local continuity of the distortion mapping, the most obvious choice is the one you've already tried: linear interpolaton between the nearest points. Going beyond that is going to require more sophisticated mathematical and numerical analysis knowledge. You are incorrect, however, in presuming you cannot expand this to more points. You can by using a least-squared error approach. Find the linear answer that minimizes the error of the other points. This is probably the most straight-forward extension. In other words, take the 5 nearest points and try to come up with a linear approximation that minimizes the error of those points. And use that. I would try this next. If that doesn't work, then the assumption of linearity over the area of N points is broken. At that point you'll need to upgrade to either a quadratic or cubic model.

In fact, I hope to get you to invent them now if you haven't already. It's then a small step to notice that all of these solutions are in fact the same solution in disguise. And after reading this, you might be in a better position to understand other documents on monads because you'll recognise everything you see as something you've already invented. Many of the problems that monads try to solve are related to the issue of side effects. So we'll start with them.

Some of the introductions to monads find it hard to reconcile these two different uses of monads and concentrate on just one or the other.)

For example, suppose we have a C++ function that takes a single floating point argument and returns a floating point result. Superficially it might seem a little like a mathematical function mapping reals to reals, but a C++ function can do more than just return a number that depends on its arguments. It can read and write the values of global variables as well as writing output to the screen and receiving input from the user. In a pure functional language, however, a function can only read what is supplied to it in its arguments and the only way it can have an effect on the world is through the values it returns. "}

{"user":"46","questionId":"2027","creationDate":"2008-08-05T16:40:35.063","answerId":"2554","type":"answer","body":"Here is another article for the c# programming language c# passes its arguments by value (by default) private void swap(string a, string b) { string tmp = a; a = b; b = tmp; } calling this version of swap will thus have no result: string x = \"foo\"; string y = \"bar\"; swap(x, y); \"output: x: foo y: bar\" however, unlike java c# does give the developer the opportunity to pass parameters by reference, this is done by using the 'ref' keyword before the type of the parameter: private void swap(ref string a, ref string b) { string tmp = a; a = b; b = tmp; } this swap will change the value of the referenced parameter: string x = \"foo\"; string y = \"bar\"; swap(x, y); \"output: x: bar y: foo\" c# also has a out keyword, and the difference between ref and out is a subtle one. from msdn: The caller of a method which takes an out parameter is not required to assign to the variable passed as the out parameter prior to the call; however, the callee is required to assign to the out parameter before returning. and In contrast ref parameters are considered initially assigned by the callee. As such, the callee is not required to assign to the ref parameter before use. Ref parameters are passed both into and out of a method. a small pitfall is, like in java, that objects passed by value can still be changed using their inner methods conclusion: c# passes its parameters, by default, by value but when needed parameters can also be passed by reference using the ref keyword inner methods from a parameter passed by value will alter the object (if that method itself alters some values) useful links: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcsharp/aa336814.aspx http://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/saragana/Willswapwork11162005012542AM/Willswapwork.aspx http://en.csharp-online.net/Value_vs_Reference "}

There are many wikis that attempt to provide WYSIWYG editing, but most of the software I've found generates nasty inefficient html markup from the WYSIWYG editor. One notable exception to this is Confluence which generates wiki syntax from a WYSIWYG editor. This still isn't perfect (show me a WYSIWYG editor that is) but is a pretty good compromise between retaining simple wiki syntax for those who like it and allowing non-technical users to contribute content. The only problem is that Confluence isn't free ($1,200 for 25 user license). Edit: I also tried DekiWiki and while the UI is nice it doesn't seem to be quite ready for primetime (suffers terribly from the bad WYSIWYG output disease mentioned above).

I can Recommend Confluence and here is why: I tested extensively many commercial and free Wiki based solutions. Not a single one is a winner on all accounts, including confluence. Let me try to make your quest a little shorter by summarizing what I have learned to be a pain and what is important: WYSIWYG is a most have feature for the Enterprise. A wiki without it, skip it Saying that, in reality, WYSIWYG doesn't work perfectly. It is more of a feature you must have to get the casual users not be afraid of the monster, and start using it. But you and anyone that wants to seriously create content, will very quickly get used to the wiki markup. it is faster and more reliable. You need good permissions controls (who can see, edit etc' a page). confluence has good, but I have my complaints (to complicated to be put here) You will want a good export feature. Most will give you a single page \"PDF\" export, but you need much more. For example, lets say you have an FAQ, you want to export the entire FAQ right? will that work? Macros: you want a community creating macros. You asked for example about the ability to rate pages, here is a link to a Macro for Confluence that lets you do that Structure: you want to be able to say that a page is a child of a different page, and be able to browse the data. The wikipedia model, of orphaned pages with no sturcture will not work in the Enterprise. (think FAQ, you want to have a hierarchy no?) Ability to easily attache picture to be embedded in the body of the page/article. In confluence, you need to upload the image and then can embed it, it could be a little better (CTR+V) but I guess this is easy enough for 80% of the users. At the end of the day, remember that a Wiki will be valuable to you the more flexible it is. It needs to be a \"blank\" canvas, and your imagination is then used to \"build\" the application. In Confluence, I found 3 different \"best practices\" on how to create a FAQ. That means I can implement MANY things. Some examples (I use my Wiki for) FAQ: any error, problem is logged. Used by PS and ENG. reduced internal support time dramatically Track account status: I implemetned sophisticated \"dashboard\" that you can see at a glance which customer is at what state, the software version they have, who in the company 'owns\" the custoemr etc' Product: all documentation, installation instructions, the \"what's new\" etc Technical documentation, DB structure and what the tables mean HR: contact list, Document repository My runner up (15 month ago) was free Deki_Wiki, time has passed, so I don't know if this would be still my runner up. good luck!

This way you won't be caching or otherwise dealing with invalid data. After all, this is what properties are meant for.

{"user":"91","questionId":"2750","creationDate":"2008-08-05T19:59:39.157","answerId":"2761","type":"answer","body":"Well, one of the reaons why classes usually contain private members with public getters/setters is exactly because they can verify data. If you have a Number than can be between 1 and 100, i would definitely put something in the setter that validates that and then maybe throw an exception that is being caught by the code. The reason is simple: If you don't do it in the setter, you have to remember that 1 to 100 limitation every time you set it, which leads to duplicated code or when you forget it, it leads to an invalid state. As for performance, i'm with Knuth here: \"We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil.\" "}

This is a hard bug to catch, but results from the way pipes are handled by the shell. Every element of a pipeline runs in a separate process. When the read command sets var1 and var2, is sets them it its own subshell, not the parent shell. So when the subshell exits, the values of var1 and var2 are lost. You can, however, try doing var1=$(echo \"Hello\") echo var1 which returns the expected answer. Unfortunately this only works for single variables, you can't set many at a time. In order to set multiple variables at a time you must either read into one variable and chop it up into multiple variables or use something like this: set -- $(echo \"Hello World\") var1=\"$1\" var2=\"$2\" echo $var1 echo $var2 While I admit it's not as elegant as using a pipe, it works. Of course you should keep in mind that read was meant to read from files into variables, so making it read from standard input should be a little harder. "}

I understand that in .NET it is essential to dispose of any instances of objects that implement the IDisposable interface to release some resources although the object can still be something after it is disposed (hence the isDisposed property in forms), so I assume it can still reside in memory or at least in part? I also know that when an object goes out of scope it is then marked for collection ready for the next pass of the garbage collector (although this may take time). So with this in mind will setting it to null speed up the system releasing the memory as it does not have to work out that it is no longer in scope and are they any bad side effects? MSDN articles never do this in examples and currently I do this as I cannot see the harm. However I have come across a mixture of opinions so any comments are useful. "}

In Java, Integer objects with the values -128 to 127 are immutable (that is, for one particular integer value, say 23, all Integer objects instantiated through your program with the value 23 points to the exact same object). Example, this returns true: Integer i1 = new Integer(127); Integer i2 = new Integer(127); System.out.println(i1 == i2); // true While this returns false: Integer i1 = new Integer(128); Integer i2 = new Integer(128); System.out.println(i1 == i2); // false The == compares by reference (does the variables point to the same object). This result may or may not differ depending on what JVM you are using. The specification autoboxing for Java 1.5 requires that integers (-128 to 127) always box to the same wrapper object. A solution? =) One should always use the Integer.equals() method when comparing Integer objects. System.out.println(i1.equals(i2)); // true More info at java.net Example at bexhuff.com "}

Put another way, I want my main non GUI-thread to be the owner of the GUI-thread and not vice versa. I'm not sure this is even possible with Windows Forms(?) Background I have a component based system in which a controller dynamically load assemblies and instantiates and run classes implementing a common IComponent interface with a single method DoStuff(). Which components that gets loaded is configured via a xml configuration file and by adding new assemblies containing different implementations of IComponent. The components provides utility functions to the main application. While the main program is doing it's thing, e.g. controlling a nuclear plant, the components might be performing utility tasks (in their own threads), e.g. cleaning the database, sending emails, printing funny jokes on the printer, what have you. What I would like, is to have one of these components be able to display a GUI, e.g. with status information for the said email sending component. The lifetime of the complete system looks like this Application starts. Check configuration file for components to load. Load them. For each component, run DoStuff() to initialize it and make it live its own life in their own threads. Continue to do main application-thingy king of work, forever. I have not yet been able to successfully perform point 3 if the component fires up a GUI in DoStuff(). It simply just halts until the GUI is closed. And not until the GUI is closed does the program progress to point 4. It would be great if these components were allowed to start up their own Windows Forms GUIs. Problem When a component tries to fire up a GUI in DoStuff() (the exact line of code is when the component runs Application.Run(theForm)), the component and hence our system \"hangs\" at the Application.Run() line until the GUI is closed. Well, the just fired up GUI works fine, as expected. Example of components. One hasn't nothing to do with GUI, whilst the second fires up a cute windows with pink fluffy bunnies in them. public class MyComponent1: IComponent { public string DoStuff(...) { // write something to the database } } public class MyComponent2: IComponent { public void DoStuff() { Application.EnableVisualStyles(); Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(false); Application.Run(new Form()); // I want the thread to immediately return after the GUI // is fired up, so that my main thread can continue to work. } } I have tried this with no luck. Even when I try to fire up the GUI in it's own thread, the execution halts until the GUI as closed. public void DoStuff() { new Thread(ThreadedInitialize).Start() } private void ThreadedInitialize() { Application.EnableVisualStyles(); Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(false); Application.Run(new Form()); } Is it possible to spin off a GUI and return after Application.Run()?

You can access a shell, have as many files open as you want in as many sub-windows and an extremely powerful scripting support that lets you add all kinds of neat features. I have been using a ruby-mode which adds syntax highlighting and whatnot to ruby, and the same exists for every major language. If you keep at it, you can use exclusively the keyboard and never touch the mouse, which increases your editing speed by a significant margin. If you want to start with something a lot more basic though, gedit is nice... it has built in syntax highlighting as well for most languages based on the filename extension. It comes with the OS as well (though emacs you can easily install with apt-get or some similar package finder utility). UPDATE: I think gedit is exclusively GUI based though, so it would be useful to learn emacs in case you are stuck with just a shell (it is fully featured in both shell and graphical mode). FURTHER UPDATE: Just FYI, I am not trying to push Emacs over Vim, it's just what I use, and it's a great editor (as I'm sure Vim is too). It is daunting at first (as I'm sure Vim is too), but the question was about text editors on Linux besides vi...

He isn't technical at all, and built the whole thing with a WYSIWYG editor. I popped his site open and viewed the source, and there was a line of Javascript includes at the bottom of the source right before the closing HTML tag. They included this file (among many others): http://www.98hs.ru/js.js <-- TURN OFF JAVASCRIPT BEFORE YOU GO TO THAT URL. So I commented it out for now. It turns out his ftp password was a plain dictionary word six letters long, so we think that's how it got hacked. We've changed his password to an 8+ digit non-word string (he wouldn't go for a passphrase since he is a hunt-n-peck typer). I did a whois on 98hs.ru and found it is hosted from a server in Chile. There is actually an e-mail address associated with it too, but I seriously doubt this person is the culprit. Probably just some other site that got hacked... I have no idea what to do at this point though as I've never dealt with this sort of thing before. Anyone have any suggestions? He was using plain jane un-secured ftp through webhost4life.com. I don't even see a way to do sftp on their site. I'm thinking his username and password got intercepted?

For example, take two common uses of a tree: The DOM File systems The DOM, and XML for that matter, resemble tree structures. It makes sense, too. It makes sense because of how this data needs to be arranged. A file system, too. On a UNIX system there's a root node, and branching down below. When you mount a new device, you're attaching it onto the tree. You should also be asking yourself: does the data fall into this type of structure? Create data structures that make sense to the problem and the rest will follow. As far as being easier, I think thats relative. Are you good with recursive functions to traverse a tree/graph? What if you need to balance the tree? Think about a program that solves a word search puzzle. You could map out all the letters of the word search into a graph and check surrounding nodes to see if that string is matching any of the words. But couldn't you just do the same with with a single array? All you really need to do is move an index to check letters to the left and right, and by the width to check above and below letters. Solving this problem with a graph isn't difficult, but it can create a lot of extra work and difficulty if you're not comfortable with using them - of course that shouldn't discourage you from doing it, especially if you are learning about them.

{"user":"358","questionId":"3021","creationDate":"2008-08-06T02:54:58.850","answerId":"3035","type":"answer","body":"Recursion is a method of solving problems based on the divide and conquer mentality. The basic idea is that you take the original problem and divide it into smaller (more easily solved) instances of itself, solve those smaller instances (usually by using the same algorithm again) and then reassemble them into the final solution. The canonical example is a routine to generate the Factorial of n. The Factorial of n is calculated by multiplying all of the numbers between 1 and n. An iterative solution in C# looks like this: public int Fact(int n) { int fact = 1; for( int i = 2; i <= n; i++) { fact = fact * i; } return fact; } There's nothing surprising about the iterative solution and it should make sense to anyone familiar with C#. The recursive solution is found by recognising that the nth Factorial is n * Fact(n-1). Or to put it another way, if you know what a particular Factorial number is you can calculate the next one. Here is the recursive solution in C#: public int FactRec(int n) { if( n < 2 ) { return 1; } return n * FactRec( n - 1 ); } The first part of this function is known as a Base Case (or sometimes Guard Clause) and is what prevents the algorithm from running forever. It just returns the value 1 whenever the function is called with a value of 1 or less. The second part is more interesting and is known as the Recursive Step. Here we call the same method with a slightly modified parameter (we decrement it by 1) and then multiply the result with our copy of n. When first encountered this can be kind of confusing so it's instructive to examine how it works when run. Imagine that we call FactRec(5). We enter the routine, are not picked up by the base case and so we end up like this: // In FactRec(5) return 5 * FactRec( 5 - 1 ); // which is return 5 * FactRec(4); If we re-enter the method with the parameter 4 we are again not stopped by the guard clause and so we end up at: // In FactRec(4) return 4 * FactRec(3); If we substitute this return value into the return value above we get // In FactRec(5) return 5 * (4 * FactRec(3)); This should give you a clue as to how the final solution is arrived at so we'll fast track and show each step on the way down: return 5 * (4 * FactRec(3)); return 5 * (4 * (3 * FactRec(2))); return 5 * (4 * (3 * (2 * FactRec(1)))); return 5 * (4 * (3 * (2 * (1)))); That final substitution happens when the base case is triggered. At this point we have a simple algrebraic formula to solve which equates directly to the definition of Factorials in the first place. It's instructive to note that every call into the method results in either a base case being triggered or a call to the same method where the parameters are closer to a base case (often called a recursive call). If this is not the case then the method will run forever. "}

If you ever have to traverse or search through something like a tree or nested identical structures, you've got a problem that might be a good candidate for recursion. People avoid recursion for a number of reasons: Most people (myself included) cut their programming teeth on procedural or object-oriented programming as opposed to functional programming. To such people, the iterative approach (typically using loops) feels more natural. Those of us who cut our programming teeth on procedural or object-oriented programming have often been told to avoid recursion because it's error prone. We're often told that recursion is slow. Calling and returning from a routine repeatedly involves a lot of stack pushing and popping, which is slower than looping. I think some languages handle this better than others, and those languages are most likely not those where the dominant paradigm is procedural or object-oriented. For at least a couple of programming languages I've used, I remember hearing recommendations not to use recursion if it gets beyond a certain depth because its stack isn't that deep. "}

(there are better ways to count things, but this is a nice simple recursive example.) First, we need two rules: if the set is empty, the count of items in the set is zero (duh!). if the set is not empty, the count is one plus the number of items in the set after one item is removed. Suppose you have a set like this: [x x x]. let's count how many items there are. the set is [x x x] which is not empty, so we apply rule 2. the number of items is one plus the number of items in [x x] (i.e. we removed an item). the set is [x x], so we apply rule 2 again: one + number of items in [x]. the set is [x], which still matches rule 2: one + number of items in []. Now the set is [], which matches rule 1: the count is zero! Now that we know the answer in step 4 (0), we can solve step 3 (1 + 0) Likewise, now that we know the answer in step 3 (1), we can solve step 2 (1 + 1) And finally now that we know the answer in step 2 (2), we can solve step 1 (1 + 2) and get the count of items in [x x x], which is 3. Hooray! We can represent this as: count of [x x x] = 1 + count of [x x] = 1 + (1 + count of [x]) = 1 + (1 + (1 + count of [])) = 1 + (1 + (1 + 0))) = 1 + (1 + (1)) = 1 + (2) = 3 When applying a recursive solution, you usually have at least 2 rules: the basis, the simple case which states what happens when you have \"used up\" all of your data. This is usually some variation of \"if you are out of data to process, your answer is X\" the recursive rule, which states what happens if you still have data. This is usually some kind of rule that says \"do something to make your data set smaller, and reapply your rules to the smaller data set.\" If we translate the above to pseudocode, we get: numberOfItems(set) if set is empty return 0 else remove 1 item from set return 1 + numberOfItems(set) There's a lot more useful examples (traversing a tree, for example) which I'm sure other people will cover.

To me, inversion of control is turning your sequentially written code and turning it into an delegation structure. Instead of your program explicitly controlling everything, your program sets up a class or library with certain functions to be called when certain things happen. It solves code duplication. For example, in the old days you would manually write your own event loop, polling the system libraries for new events. Nowadays, most modern APIs you simply tell the system libraries what events you're interested in, and it will let you know when they happen. Inversion of control is a practical way to reduce code duplication, and if you find yourself copying an entire method and only changing a small piece of the code, you can consider tackling it with inversion of control. Inversion of control is made easy in many languages through the concept of delegates, interfaces, or even raw function pointers. It is not appropriate to use in all cases, because the flow of a program can be harder to follow when written this way. It's a useful way to design methods when writing a library that will be reused, but it should be used sparingly in the core of your own program unless it really solves a code duplication problem. "}

{"user":"101","questionId":"3021","creationDate":"2008-08-06T05:09:44.770","answerId":"3093","type":"answer","body":"There are a number of good explanations of recursion in this thread, this answer is about why you shouldn't use it in most languages.* In the majority of major imperative language implementations (i.e. every major implementation of C, C++, Basic, Python, Ruby,Java, and C#) iteration is vastly preferable to recursion. To see why, walk through the steps that the above languages use to call a function: space is carved out on the stack for the function's arguments and local variables the function's arguments are copied into this new space control jumps to the function the function's code runs the function's result is copied into a return value the stack is rewound to its previous position control jumps back to where the function was called Doing all of these steps takes time, usually a little bit more than it takes to iterate through a loop. However, the real problem is in step #1. When many programs start, they allocate a single chunk of memory for their stack, and when they run out of that memory (often, but not always due to recursion), the program crashes due to a stack overflow. So in these languages recursion is slower and it makes you vulnerable to crashing. There are still some arguments for using it though. In general, code written recursively is shorter and a bit more elegant, once you know how to read it. There is a technique that language implementers can use called tail call optimization which can eliminate some classes of stack overflow. Put succinctly: if a function's return expression is simply the result of a function call, then you don't need to add a new level onto the stack, you can reuse the current one for the function being called. Regrettably, few imperative language-implementations have tail-call optimization built in. * I love recursion. My favorite static language doesn't use loops at all, recursion is the only way to do something repeatedly. I just don't think that recursion is generally a good idea in languages that aren't tuned for it. ** By the way Mario, the typical name for your ArrangeString function is \"join\", and I'd be surprised if your language of choice doesn't already have an implementation of it.

I'm assuming that you need to lookup a node by its label, so you want a dict of dicts. However, on the performance front, loading it into memory may not be a problem, but if you use too much you'll end up swapping to disk, which will kill the performance of even Python's highly efficient dicts. Try to keep memory usage down as much as possible. Also, RAM is amazingly cheap right now; if you do this kind of thing a lot, there's no reason not to have at least 4GB. If you'd like advice on keeping memory usage down, give some more information about the kind of information you're tracking for each node. "}

This is the closest thing I've got to documentation. It's still a work in progress, but I hope it helps. 1) FizzBuzz. Start with command line programs. You can write some fun games, or tools, very quickly, and you learn all of the language features very quickly without having to learn the GUI tools first. These early apps should be simple enough that you won't need to use any real debugging tools to make them work. If nothing else things like FizzBuzz are good projects. Your first few apps should not have to deal with DBs, file system, configuration, ect. These are concepts which just confuse most people, and when you're just learning the syntax and basic framework features you really don't need more complexity. Some projects: Hello World! Take the year of my birth, and calculate my age (just (now - then) no month corrections). (simple math, input, output) Ask for a direction(Up, down, left, right), then tell the user their fate (fall in a hole, find a cake, ect). (Boolean logic) FizzBuzz, but count once every second. (Loops, timers, and more logic) Depending on their age some really like an app which calls the users a random insult at some interval. (Loops, arrays, timers, and random if you make the interval random) 2) Simple Project Once they have a good grasp of language features, you can start a project(simple, fun games work good.). You should try to have the first project be able to be completed within 6-12 hours. Don't spend time to architect it early. Let them design it even if it sucks. If it falls apart, talk about what happened and why it failed, then pick another topic and start again. This is where you start introducing the debugging capabilities of your tools. Even if you can see the problem by reading the code you should teach them how to use the tools, and then show them how you could see it. That serves the dual purpose of teaching the debugging tools and teaching how to ID errors without tools. Once, or if, the project gets functional you can use it to introduce refactoring tools. Its good if you can then expand the project with some simple features which you never planned for. This usually means refactoring and significant debugging, since very few people write even half decent code their first time. Some projects: Hangman game Experimenting with robotics(Vex and Mindstorms are options) 3) Real Project Start a real project which may take some time. Use proper source control, and make a point to have a schedule. Run this project like a real project, if nothing else its good experience having to deal with the tools. Obviously you need to adjust this for each person. The most important thing I've found is to make even the first simple apps apply to what the person is interested in.

In an IoC scenario we would instead do something like this: public class TextEditor { private IocSpellChecker checker; public TextEditor(IocSpellChecker checker) { this.checker = checker; } } In the first code example we are instantiating SpellChecker (this.checker = new SpellChecker();), which means the TextEditor class directly depends on the SpellChecker class. In the second code example we are creating an abstraction by having the the SpellChecker dependency class in TextEditor constructor signature (not initializing dependency in class). This allows us to call the dependency then pass it to the TextEditor class like so: SpellChecker sc = new SpellChecker; // dependency TextEditor textEditor = new TextEditor(sc); Now, the client creating the TextEditor class has the control over which SpellChecker implementation to use. We're injecting the the dependency to the TextEditor signature. This is just a simple example, there's a good series of articles by Simone Busoli that explains it in greater detail. "}

Extension methods that relate to specific business needs of a project (whether they are connected to basic data types or custom objects) should not be included in a library that would be distributed across multiple projects. Extension methods that relate to basic data types (int, string, etc) or generics that have a wider application could be packaged and distributed across projects.

I found it a lot nicer than paper as I'm working on multiple projects, and my paper tends to get rather messy once you start making annotations or if you want to re-organize and shuffle tasks around, mark them as complete only to see that they are not complete after all... Plus, the Visual Studio integration is really neat, something paper just cannot compete with. Also, if you lay the project to rest for 6 months and come back, all your tasks and notes are still there, whereas with paper you may need to search all the old documents and notes again, if you did not discard it. But that is just the point of view from someone who is not really good at staying organized :-) If you are a really tidy and organized person, paper may work better for you than it does for me. Bonus suggestion: Run Fogbugz on a second PC (or a small Laptop like the eeePC) so that you always have it at your fingertips.

To find the peak value we currently search the array for the highest reading and use the index to determine the timing of the peak value which is used in our calculations. This works well if the highest value is the peak we are looking for but if the device is not working correctly we can see a second peak which can be higher than the initial peak. We take 10 readings a second from 16 devices over a 90 second period. My initial thoughts are to cycle through the readings checking to see if the previous and next points are less than the current to find a peak and construct an array of peaks. Maybe we should be looking at a average of a number of points either side of the current position to allow for noise in the system. Is this the best way to proceed or are there better techniques?

A brief overview of these are as follows: Data is retrieved from external webservices Data is stored in SQL 2005 Data is manipulated via a web GUI The windows service that communicates with the web services has no coupling with our internal web UI, except via the database. Communication with the web services needs to be both time-based, and triggered via user intervention on the web UI. The current (pre-pre-production) model for web service communication triggering is via a database table that stores trigger requests generated from the manual intervention. I do not really want to have multiple trigger mechanisms, but would like to be able to populate the database table with triggers based upon the time of the call. As I see it there are two ways to accomplish this. 1) Adapt the trigger table to store two extra parameters. One being \"Is this time-based or manually added?\" and a nullable field to store the timing details (exact format to be determined). If it is a manaully created trigger, mark it as processed when the trigger has been fired, but not if it is a timed trigger. or 2) Create a second windows service that creates the triggers on-the-fly at timed intervals. The second option seems like a fudge to me, but the management of option 1 could easily turn into a programming nightmare (how do you know if the last poll of the table returned the event that needs to fire, and how do you then stop it re-triggering on the next poll) I'd appreciate it if anyone could spare a few minutes to help me decide which route (one of these two, or possibly a third, unlisted one) to take.

{"user":"486","questionId":"564","creationDate":"2008-08-06T11:08:52.283","answerId":"3285","type":"answer","body":"In Java there are two basic types in the JVM. 1) Primitive types and 2) Reference Types. int is a primitive type and Integer is a class type (which is kind of reference type). Primitive values do not share state with other primitive values. A variable whose type is a primitive type always holds a primitive value of that type. int aNumber = 4; int anotherNum = aNumber; aNumber += 6; System.out.println(anotherNum); // Prints 4 An object is a dynamically created class instance or an array. The reference values (often just references) are pointers to these objects and a special null reference, which refers to no object. There may be many references to the same object. Integer aNumber = Integer.valueOf(4); Integer anotherNumber = aNumber; // anotherNumber references the // same object as aNumber Also in Java everything is passed by value. With objects the value that is passed is the reference to the object. So another difference between int and Integer in java is how they are passed in method calls. For example in public int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; } final int two = 2; int sum = add(1, two); The variable two is passed as the primitive integer type 2. Whereas in public int add(Integer a, Integer b) { return a.intValue() + b.intValue(); } final Integer two = Integer.valueOf(2); int sum = add(Integer.valueOf(1), two); The variable two is passed as a reference to an object that holds the integer value 2. @WolfmanDragon: Pass by reference would work like so: public void increment(int x) { x = x + 1; } int a = 1; increment(a); // a is now 2 When increment is called it passes a reference (pointer) to variable a. And the increment function directly modifies variable a. And for object types it would work as follows: public void increment(Integer x) { x = Integer.valueOf(x.intValue() + 1); } Integer a = Integer.valueOf(1); increment(a); // a is now 2 Do you see the difference now?

Since static methods are defined on the type, not the instance, of a class, they must be called explicitly on that type. So when you want to call a method on a child class, you need to use its name to call it. This makes inheritance irrelevant. Assume you could, for a moment, inherit static methods. Imagine this scenario: public static class Base { public static virtual int GetNumber() { return 5; } } public static class Child1 : Base { public static override int GetNumber() { return 1; } } public static class Child2 : Base { public static override int GetNumber() { return 2; } } If you call Base.GetNumber(), which method would be called?

A call to a static method is done through the class name, not through an object reference, and the IL code to call it will call the abstract method through the name of the class that defined it, not necessarily the name of the class you used. Let me show an example. With the following code: public class A { public static void Test() { } } public class B : A { } If you call B.Test, like this: class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { B.Test(); } } Then the actual code inside the Main method is as follows: .entrypoint .maxstack 8 L0000: nop L0001: call void ConsoleApplication1.A::Test() L0006: nop L0007: ret As you can see, the call is made to A.Test, because it was the A class that defined it, and not to B.Test, even though you can write the code that way. If you had class types, like in Delphi, where you can make a variable referring to a type and not an object, you would have more use for virtual and thus abstract static methods (and also constructors), but they aren't available and thus static calls are non-virtual in .NET. I realize that the IL designers could allow the code to be compiled to call B.Test, and resolve the call at runtime, but it still wouldn't be virtual, as you would still have to write some kind of class name there. Virtual methods, and thus abstract ones, are only useful when you're using a variable which, at runtime, can contain many different types of objects, and you thus want to call the right method for the current object you have in the variable. With static methods you need to go through a class name anyway, so the exact method to call is known at compile time because it can't and won't change. Thus, virtual/abstract static methods are not available in .NET. "}

If you just want the keys and do not plan to ever read any of the values, use keys(): foreach my $key (keys %hash) { ... } If you just want the values, use values(): foreach my $val (values %hash) { ... } If you need the keys and the values, use each(): keys %hash; # reset the internal iterator so a prior each() doesn't affect the loop while(my($k, $v) = each %hash) { ... } If you plan to change the keys of the hash in any way except for deleting the current key during the iteration, then you must not use each(). For example, this code to create a new set of uppercase keys with doubled values works fine using keys(): %h = (a => 1, b => 2); foreach my $k (keys %h) { $h{uc $k} = $h{$k} * 2; } producing the expected resulting hash: (a => 1, A => 2, b => 2, B => 4) But using each() to do the same thing: %h = (a => 1, b => 2); keys %h; while(my($k, $v) = each %h) { $h{uc $k} = $h{$k} * 2; # BAD IDEA! } produces incorrect results in hard-to-predict ways.

It is usually used in conjunction with processing data sets (lists) but can be used elsewhere. A few examples of how it's used in C code. Say we have an array of n elements int array[n]; If we wanted to access the first element of the array this would be O(1) since it doesn't matter how big the array is, it always takes the same constant time to get the first item. x = array[0]; If we wanted to find a number in the list: for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){ if(array[i] == numToFind){ return i; } } This would be O(n) since at most we would have to look through the entire list to find our number. The Big-O is still O(n) even though we might find our number the first try and run through the loop once because Big-O describes the upper bound for an algorithm (omega is for lower bound and theta is for tight bound). When we get to nested loops: for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){ for(int j = i; j < n; j++){ array[j] += 2; } } This is O(n^2) since for each pass of the outer loop ( O(n) ) we have to go through the entire list again so the n's multiply leaving us with n squared.

For example, the page could be made of up components, or templates, and then thrown together right before the browser renders it. This isn't an excuse, but you can't assume that the HTML you're seeing was hand coded all at once. What if some of the code generated by Markdown is invalid? You can't blame Stack Overflow for not producing valid code. Lastly, the purpose of the DOCTYPE is not to simply say \"Hey, I'm using valid code\" but it's also to give the browser a heads up what you're trying to do so that it can at least come close to correctly parsing that information.

{"user":"164","questionId":"3448","creationDate":"2008-08-06T14:46:40.660","answerId":"3492","type":"answer","body":"There are many reasons to use valid markup. My favorite is that it allows you to use validation as a form of regression testing, preventing the markup equivalent of \"delta rot\" from leading to real rendering problems once the errors reach some critical mass. And really, it's just plain sloppy to allow \"lazy\" errors like typos and mis-nested/unclosed tags to accumulate. Valid markup is one way to identify passionate programmers. There's also the issue of debugging: valid markup also gives you a stable baseline from which to work on the inevitable cross-browser compatibility woes. No web developer who values his time should begin debugging browser compatibility problems without first ensuring that the markup is at least syntactically valid\u2014and any other invalid markup should have a good reason for being there. (Incidentally, stackoverflow.com fails both these tests, and suggestions to fix the problems were declined.) All of that said, to answer your specific question, it's probably not worthwhile to use one of the XHTML doctypes unless you plan to produce valid (or at least well-formed) markup. XHTML's primary advantages are derived from the fact that XHTML is XML, allowing it to be processed and transformed by tools and technologies that work with XML. If you don't plan to make your XHTML well-formed XML, then there's little point in choosing that doctype. The latest HTML 4 spec will probably do everything you need, and it's much more forgiving. "}

BODMAS can come to the rescue and give us rules to follow so that we always get the right answer: (B)rackets (O)rder (D)ivision (M)ultiplication (A)ddition (S)ubtraction According to BODMAS, multiplication should always be done before addition, therefore 17 is actually the correct answer according to BODMAS and will also be the answer which your calculator will give if you type in 2 + 3 x 5 .

That means all of the queries written above with the % and _ are not valid full text queries. Here is a sample of what a query looks like when calling the CONTAINSTABLE function. SELECT RANK , * FROM TableName , CONTAINSTABLE (TableName, *, ' \"*WildCard\" ') searchTable WHERE [KEY] = TableName.pk ORDER BY searchTable.RANK DESC In order for the CONTAINSTABLE function to know that I'm using a wildcard search, I have to wrap it in double quotes. I can use the wildcard character * at the beginning or ending. There are a lot of other things you can do when you're building the search string for the CONTAINSTABLE function. You can search for a word near another word, search for inflectional words (drive = drives, drove, driving, and driven), and search for synonym of another word (metal can have synonyms such as aluminum and steel). I just created a table, put a full text index on the table and did a couple of test searches and didn't have a problem, so wildcard searching works as intended. [Update] I see that you've updated your question and know that you need to use one of the functions. You can still search with the wildcard at the beginning, but if the word is not a full word following the wildcard, you have to add another wildcard at the end. Example: \"*ildcar\" will look for a single word as long as it ends with \"ildcar\". Example: \"*ildcar*\" will look for a single word with \"ildcar\" in the middle, which means it will match \"wildcard\". [Just noticed that Markdown removed the wildcard characters from the beginning and ending of my quoted string here.] [Update #2] Dave Ward - Using a wildcard with one of the functions shouldn't be a huge perf hit. If I created a search string with just \"*\", it will not return all rows, in my test case, it returned 0 records. "}

And then there are some languages where order of operations isn't really all that meaningful (Lisp dialects, for example). In a way, you're probably better off for programming if you forget the standard order and either use parentheses for everything(eg (a*b) + c) or specifically learn the order for each language you work in.

I've never really used anything else, so I'm not sure what my options are. Downsides to ClickOnce: Consists of multiple files - Seems easier to distribute one file than manageing a bunch of file and the downloader to download those files. You have to build it again for CD installations (for when the end user dosn't have internet) Program does not end up in Program Files - It ends up hidden away in some application catch folder, making it much harder to shortcut to. Pros to ClickOnce: It works. Magically. And it's built into VisualStudio 2008 express. Makes it easy to upgrade the application. Does Windows Installer do these things as well? I know it dosen't have any of the ClickOnce cons, but It would be nice to know if it also has the ClickOnce pros. Update: I ended up using Wix 2 (Wix 3 was available but at the time I did the project, no one had a competent tutorial). It was nice because it supported the three things I (eventually) needed. An optional start-up-with-windows shortcut, a start-up-when-the-installer-is-done option, and three paragraphs of text that my boss thinks will keep uses from clicking the wrong option. "}

The function of the application is simply a pass-through for data from a serial device to a file. It performs many, many transformations on the data before writing it to the file, so the GUI for the application is simply all the settings that dictate what those transformations should be. What's the best way to go about designing/coding a tree-view preferences dialog? The way I've been going about it is building the main window with a docked tree control on the left. Then I have been creating container controls that correspond to each node of the tree. When a node is selected, the app brings that node's corresponding container control to the front, moves it to the right position, and maximizes it in the main window. This seems really, really clunky while designing it. It basically means I have tons of container controls beyond the edge of the main window during design time that I have to keep scrolling the main window over to in order to work with them. I don't know if this totally makes sense the way I'm writing this, but maybe this visual for what I'm talking about will make more sense: Basically I have to work with this huge form, with container controls all over the place, and then do a bunch of run-time reformatting to make it all work.

I can get the windows privileges by simply configuring the timer service to use an account which is a member of local administrators. I understand that this is not a good solution since it gives SharePoint timer service more rights then it is supposed to have. But it at least allows my SharePoint timer job to run stsadm. Another problem with running the timer service under local administrator is that this user won't necessarily have SHAREPOINT\\System SharePoint privileges which I also need for this SharePoint job. It turns out that SPSecurity.RunWithElevatedPrivileges won't work in this case. Reflector shows that RunWithElevatedPrivileges checks if the current process is owstimer (the service process which runs SharePoint jobs) and performs no elevation this is the case (the rational here, I guess, is that the timer service is supposed to run under NT AUTHORITY\\NetworkService windows account which which has SHAREPOINT\\System SharePoint privileges, and thus there's no need to elevate privileges for a timer job). The only possible solution here seems to be to run the timer service under its usual NetworkService windows account and to run stsadm as a local administrator by storing the administrator credentials somewhere and passing them to System.Diagnostics.Process.Run() trough the StarInfo's Username, domain and password. It seems everything should work now, but here is another problem I'm stuck with at the moment. Stsamd is failing with the following error popup (!) (Winternals filemon shows that stsadm is running under the administrator in this case): The application failed to initialize properly (0x0c0000142). Click OK to terminate the application. Event Viewer registers nothing except the popup. The local administrator user is my account and when I just run stsadm interactively under this account everything is ok.

I want to be able to replicate data on both servers continuously, but have run into several roadblocks. One of them being, under MySQL master/slave configurations, every now and then, some statements drop (!), meaning; some people logging on to the mirror URL don't see data that I know is on the main server and vice versa. Let's say this happens on a meaningful block of data once every month, so I can live with it and assume it's a \"lost packet\" issue (i.e., god knows, but we'll compensate). The other most important (and annoying) recurring issue is that, when for some reason we do a major upload or update (or reboot) on one end and have to sever the link, then LOAD DATA FROM MASTER doesn't work and I have to manually dump on one end and upload on the other, quite a task nowadays moving some .5 TB worth of data. Is there software for this? I know MySQL (the \"corporation\") offers this as a VERY expensive service (full database replication). What do people out there do? The way it's structured, we run an automatic failover where if one server is not up, then the main URL just resolves to the other server. "}

I say it's safe to say that web servers is one of the most common (and ironed out) uses of parallel code. And since you are able to split up much of the processing into multiple discrete threads, more cores actually does benefit you. This is one of the big reasons why shared hosting is even possible. If server software like IIS and Apache couldn't run requests in parallel it would mean that every page request would have to be dished out in a queue fashion...likely making load times unbearably slow. This also why high end server Operating Systems like Windows 2008 Server Enterprise support something like 64 cores and 2TB of RAM. These are applications that can actually take advantage of that many cores. Also, since each request is likely has low CPU load, you can probably (for some applications) get away with more slower cores. But obviously having each core faster can mean being able to get each task done quicker and, in theory, handle more tasks and more server requests. "}

First, I want to repeat what I think you are saying and make sure I'm clear. You want to disallow requests to servlet1 and servlet2 is the request doesn't have the proper referer and it does have a query string? I'm not sure I understand (servlet1|servlet2)/.+\\?.+ because it looks like you are requiring a file under servlet1 and 2. I think maybe you are combining PATH_INFO (before the \"?\") with a GET query string (after the \"?\"). It appears that the PATH_INFO part will work but the GET query test will not. I made a quick test on my server using script1.cgi and script2.cgi and the following rules worked to accomplish what you are asking for. They are obviously edited a little to match my environment: RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^http://(www.)?example.(com|org) [NC] RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} ^.+$ RewriteRule ^(script1|script2)\\.cgi - [F] The above caught all wrong-referer requests to script1.cgi and script2.cgi that tried to submit data using a query string. However, you can also submit data using a path_info and by posting data. I used this form to protect against any of the three methods being used with incorrect referer: RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^http://(www.)?example.(com|org) [NC] RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} ^.+$ [OR] RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} ^POST$ [OR] RewriteCond %{PATH_INFO} ^.+$ RewriteRule ^(script1|script2)\\.cgi - [F] Based on the example you were trying to get working, I think this is what you want: RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^http://mywebaddress(.cl)?/.* [NC] RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} ^.+$ [OR] RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} ^POST$ [OR] RewriteCond %{PATH_INFO} ^.+$ RewriteRule (servlet1|servlet2)\\b - [F] Hopefully this at least gets you closer to your goal.

Here are the ones I see most used: svn - currently the most popular open source? git - very hot since Linus switched to it mercurial - some smart people I know swear by it cvs - the one everybody is switching from perforce - imho, the best features, but it's not open source. The two-user license is free, though. visual sourcesafe - I'm not much in the Microsoft world, so I have no idea about this one, other than people like to rag on it as they rag on everything from Microsoft. sccs - for historical interest we mention this, the great-grandaddy of many of the above rcs - and the grandaddy of many of the above My recommendation: you're safest with either git, svn or perforce, since a lot of people use them, they are cross platform, have good guis, you can buy books about them, etc. Dont consider cvs, sccs, rcs, they are antique.

But as soon as I disconnect the tool the connection gets lost. #!/usr/bin/python import serial ser = serial.Serial('/dev/cu.usbserial', 9600, timeout=10) ser.write(\"<ID01><PA> \\r\\n\") read_chars = ser.read(20) print read_chars ser.close() So the question is, what magicks do I need to perform to start talking to the serial port without the serial port tool? Is that a permissions problem? Also, what's the difference between /dev/cu.usbserial and /dev/tty.usbserial? Nope, no serial numbers. The thing is, the problem persists even with sudo-running the python script, and the only thing that makes it go through if I open the connection in the gui tool that I mentioned. "}

Obviously you can solve any problem in either style (procedural or OO), but you usually can figure out in the planning stages before you start writing code which style suits you better. Some people like to write up use cases and if they see a lot of the same nouns showing up over and over again (e.g., a person withdraws money from the bank), then they go the OO route and use the nouns as their objects. Conversely, if you don't see a lot of nouns and there's really more verbs going on, then procedural or functional may be the way to go.

This web site describes what code to actual use to implement SSL with asp.net and this site describes how to set up the certificates (although I'm not sure if it works only for IIS or not). The class documentation describes various types of authentication (basic, digest, Windows, etc.) --- none of them refer to SSL. It does say that if HTTPS is used, you will need to set a server certificate. Is this going to be a one line property setting and HttpListener figures out the rest? In short, I need to know how to set up the certificates and how to modify the code to implement SSL. Although it doesn't occur when I'm trying to access HTTPS, I did notice an error in my System Event log - the source is \"Schannel\" and the content of the message is: A fatal error occurred when attempting to access the SSL server credential private key. The error code returned from the cryptographic module is 0x80090016. Edit: Steps taken so far Created a working HTTPListener in C# that works for HTTP connections (e.g. \"http://localhost:8089/foldername/\" Created a certificate using makecert.exe Added the certificate to be trusted using certmgr.exe Used Httpcfg.exe to listen for SSL connections on a test port (e.g. 8090) Added port 8080 to the HTTPListener via listener.Prefixes.Add(https://localhost:8090/foldername/\"); tested an HTTP client connection, e.g. (http://localhost:8089/foldername/\") in a browser and receive correct return tested an HTTPS client connection, e.g. (http://localhost:8090/foldername/\") in a browser and receive \"Data Transfer Interrupted\" (in Firefox) debugging in visual studio shows that the listener callback that receives the requests never gets hit when the HTTPS connection starts - I don't see any place that I could set a breakpoint to catch anything else earlier. netstat shows that listening ports are open for both HTTPS and HTTP. the HTTPS port does go to TIME_WAIT after a connection is attempted. Fiddler and HTTPAnalyzer don't catch any of the traffic, I guess it doesn't get far enough in the process to show up in those HTTP analysis tools Questions What could the problem be? Is there a piece of .Net code I am missing (meaning I have to do more in C# other than simply add a prefix to the listener that points to HTTPS, which is what i have done) Have a missed a configuration step somewhere? What else might I do to analyze the problem? Is the error message in the System Event log a sign of the problem? If so how would it be fixed? "}

The answer is of course yes, because we as human being make mistakes all the time. As programmers, its often the case though that it can take several hours of testing, code changes, overwrites, deletions, file moves and renames before we work out the method we are trying to use to fix a problem is entirely the wrong one and the code is more broken than when we started. As such, Source Control is a massive Undo button to revert the code to an earlier time when the grass was green and the food plentiful. And not only that, because of how source control works, you can still keep a copy of your broken code, in case a few weeks down the line you want to refer to it again and cherry pick any good ideas that did come out of it. I personally (though it could be called overkill) use a free Single user license version of Source Gear Fortress (which is their Vault source control product with bug tracking features). I find the UI really simple to use, it supports both the checkout > edit > checkin model and the edit > merge > commit model. It can be a little tricky to set up though, requiring you to run a local copy of ISS and SQL server. You might want to try a smaller program, like those recommended by other answers here.

As the user changes settings using the app's UI (clicking checkboxes, choosing radio buttons, etc.), I plan to be writing those changes out to the AppSettings. At the same time, while the program is running I plan to be accessing the AppSettings constantly from a process that will be constantly processing data. Changes to settings via the UI need to affect the data processing in real-time, which is why the process will be accessing the AppSettings constantly. Is this a good idea with regard to performance? Using AppSettings is supposed to be \"the right way\" to store and access configuration settings when writing .Net apps, but I worry that this method wasn't intended for a constant load (at least in terms of settings being constantly read). If anyone has experience with this, I would greatly appreciate the input. Update: I should probably clarify a few points. This is not a web application, so connecting a database to the application might be overkill simply for storing configuration settings. This is a Windows Forms application. According to the MSDN documention, the ConfigurationManager is for storing not just application level settings, but user settings as well. (Especially important if, for instance, the application is installed as a partial-trust application.) Update 2: I accepted lomaxx's answer because Properties does indeed look like a good solution, without having to add any additional layers to my application (such as a database). When using Properties, it already does all the caching that others suggested. This means any changes and subsequent reads are all done in memory, making it extremely fast. Properties only writes the changes to disk when you explicitly tell it to. This means I can make changes to the config settings on-the-fly at run time and then only do a final save out to disk when the program exits. Just to verify it would actually be able to handle the load I need, I did some testing on my laptop and was able to do 750,000 reads and 7,500 writes per second using Properties. That is so far above and beyond what my application will ever even come close to needing that I feel quite safe in using Properties without impacting performance. "}

It's hard to beat Apache Subversion (free). Team Foundation Server is quite expensive, so the extra features would really have to kick Subversion in the pants. Does anyone have practical experience with both? How do they compare? Is Team Foundation Server actually worth the expense? "}

You have all this opportunities to cache: Accessing the Data Base where you cache the data first correctly tuning your RDBMS, then using a layer to delegate the decision to detect multiple queries for the same data (with AdoDB for example.) Extracting calculations from loops in the code so you don't compute the same value multiple times. Here your third way: storing results in the session for the user. Precompiling the PHP code with an extension like APC Cache. This way you don't have to compile the same PHP code for every request. The page sent to the user making sure you're setting the right META tags (do a good thing for the world and don't use ETL at least absolutly necessary); or maybe making dynamic pages completely static (having a batch process that generates .html pages); or by using a proxy cache like Squid. Prefetching and by this I refer all those opportunities you have to improve the user experience just by doing things while the user don't look your way. For example, preloading IMG tags in the HTML file, tunning the RDBMS for prefectching, precomputing results storing complex computations in the database, etc. From my experience, I'd bet you that your code can be improved a lot before we start to talk about caching things. Consider, for example, how well structured is the navigation of your site and how well you control the user experience. Then check your code with a tool like XDebug. Verify also how well are you making your SQL queries and how well are you indexing your tables. Then check your code again to look for opportunities to apply the rule \"read many times but write just once\" Use a simple tool like YSlow to hint other simple things to improve. Check your code again looking for opportunities to put logic in the browser (via JavaScript) "}

However, in this case, I would strongly recommend looking at all options, including commercial products. I tried to play with nProf (which is at version 0.1 I think) and didn't have much luck. Even so, performance profiling an application is a subtle business and is best approached using a powerful, flexible tool. Unless you are working for free, I strongly believe the time you will save using a professional product will far outweigh the cost of a license. And of course, if you are only wanting to profile a single application, each commercial package has a 15 or 30 day trial, more than enough time to pinpoint any issues in an existing application. And if you need profiling support for more than just the one-off project, you're better buying a full strength tool anyway. We use the ANTS profiler from RedGate and have been very happy with it. I have also used .NET Memory Profiler with excellent results. The cool thing about .NET Memory Profiler is that it can attach to and profile running production applications, which really saved our butts when we had a memory leak in production we couldn't reproduce in our test lab. The JetBrains folks have a profiler as well called dotTrace which I haven't tried, but I have to believe that if it comes from the JetBrains shop it is probably top notch as well. Anyway, my advice is this: try to fix your app within the free trial window of one or an aggregated combination of the three of them (minimum of 45 days free use) and if that isn't enough time, pick your favorite and spring for one of them. You won't be sorry. "}

This is unnecessary The best approach would be to use a database to store your configuration settings. Barring the use of a database, you could easily setup an external XML configuration file.

In short, I need to keep track of a relatively small number of values (usually a value of 1, and in rare cases more than 1) in a sea of zeros in the matrix (multidimensional array). A sparse array allows the user to store a small number of values, and assume all undefined records to be a preset value. Since it is not physically possibly to store all values in memory, I need to store only the few non-zero elements. This could be several million entries. Speed is a huge priority, and I would also like to dynamically choose the number of variables in the class at runtime. I currently work on a system that uses a binary search tree (b-tree) to store entries. Does anyone know of a better system? "}

Several million objects won't be a problem. 10 million items took about 4.4 seconds and about 57 meg on my computer.

For instance, an item located at [23][55] can be represented via \"23,55\" string. We can also extend this solution for higher dimensions; such as for three dimensions an arbitrary index will look like \"34,45,56\". A simple implementation of this technique is as follows: std::map data<string,int> data; char ix[100]; sprintf(ix, \"%d,%d\", x, y); // 2 vars data[ix] = i; sprintf(ix, \"%d,%d,%d\", x, y, z); // 3 vars data[ix] = i; "}

The savings add up quickly. Collaboration If you are writing a nicely encapsulated piece of code that needs to interact with someone else's code (that hasn't been written yet, or is in being developed in parallel - a common scenario), you can exercise your code with mock objects once an interface has been agreed upon.

The two most popular design patterns for this at the time seem to be MVP and MVC. Both separate the logic of the application away from the view so that you can test the logic without the view (web pages) getting in your way. Either MVP or MVC will be effective. MVC has the advantage of having a Microsoft framework almost ready to go. Once you've selected a framework pattern that encourages testability, you need to use a unit testing tool. NUnit is a good starting point. Visual Studio Professional has a testing suite built it, but NUnit + TestDrive.NET also works in the IDE. That's sort of a shotgun blast of information.

Is there some killer IDE/debugger/editor combination I'm not aware of? It has to be easier than this, though. I've heard some mention of Eclipse - is it a good choice here? I know very little about it. Edit: Some of you have pointed out Firebug - I guess my problem was that I'm not actually using JavaScript for web development for which Firebug seems to be the tool -- instead I'm using it for XUL development in xulrunner. Which may simply be a weakness or immaturity of xulrunner. "}

It has been hashed with a one way hash which if you don't know is irreversible. I recommend go with Xenph Yan above and just create an new one. You can also use the following procedure from the manual for resetting the password for any MySQL root accounts on Windows: Log on to your system as Administrator. Stop the MySQL server if it is running. For a server that is running as a Windows service, go to the Services manager: Start Menu -> Control Panel -> Administrative Tools -> Services Then find the MySQL service in the list, and stop it. If your server is not running as a service, you may need to use the Task Manager to force it to stop. Create a text file and place the following statements in it. Replace the password with the password that you want to use. UPDATE mysql.user SET Password=PASSWORD('MyNewPass') WHERE User='root'; FLUSH PRIVILEGES; The UPDATE and FLUSH statements each must be written on a single line. The UPDATE statement resets the password for all existing root accounts, and the FLUSH statement tells the server to reload the grant tables into memory. Save the file. For this example, the file will be named C:\\mysql-init.txt. Open a console window to get to the command prompt: Start Menu -> Run -> cmd Start the MySQL server with the special --init-file option: C:\\> C:\\mysql\\bin\\mysqld-nt --init-file = C:\\mysql-init.txt If you installed MySQL to a location other than C:\\mysql, adjust the command accordingly. The server executes the contents of the file named by the --init-file option at startup, changing each root account password. You can also add the --console option to the command if you want server output to appear in the console window rather than in a log file. If you installed MySQL using the MySQL Installation Wizard, you may need to specify a --defaults-file option: C:\\> \"C:\\Program Files\\MySQL\\MySQL Server 5.0\\bin\\mysqld-nt.exe\" --defaults-file=\"C:\\Program Files\\MySQL\\MySQL Server 5.0\\my.ini\" --init-file=C:\\mysql-init.txt The appropriate --defaults-file setting can be found using the Services Manager: Start Menu -> Control Panel -> Administrative Tools -> Services Find the MySQL service in the list, right-click on it, and choose the Properties option. The Path to executable field contains the --defaults-file setting. After the server has started successfully, delete C:\\mysql-init.txt. Stop the MySQL server, then restart it in normal mode again. If you run the server as a service, start it from the Windows Services window. If you start the server manually, use whatever command you normally use. You should now be able to connect to MySQL as root using the new password. "}

There seems to be no real way to know if a file is open for writing by another application. So, reading from such a file will just progress until content is exhausted. I took Mike's advice and wrote some test code: Writer.java writes a string to file and then waits for the user to hit enter before writing another line to file. The idea being that it could be started up, then a reader can be started to see how it copes with the \"partial\" file. The reader I wrote is in Reader.java. Writer.java public class Writer extends Object { Writer () { } public static String[] strings = { \"Hello World\", \"Goodbye World\" }; public static void main(String[] args) throws java.io.IOException { java.io.PrintWriter pw = new java.io.PrintWriter(new java.io.FileOutputStream(\"out.txt\"), true); for(String s : strings) { pw.println(s); System.in.read(); } pw.close(); } } Reader.java public class Reader extends Object { Reader () { } public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception { java.io.FileInputStream in = new java.io.FileInputStream(\"out.txt\"); java.nio.channels.FileChannel fc = in.getChannel(); java.nio.ByteBuffer bb = java.nio.ByteBuffer.allocate(10); while(fc.read(bb) >= 0) { bb.flip(); while(bb.hasRemaining()) { System.out.println((char)bb.get()); } bb.clear(); } System.exit(0); } } No guarantees that this code is best practice. This leaves the option suggested by Mike of periodically checking if there is new data to be read from the file. This then requires user intervention to close the file reader when it is determined that the reading is completed. Or, the reader needs to be made aware the content of the file and be able to determine and end of write condition. If the content were XML, the end of document could be used to signal this. "}

With that said I must add that even the professor encouraged us (later on) to actually think about it instead of just calculating it. Also I would like to add how it is done for recursive functions: suppose we have a function like (scheme code): (define (fac n) (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (fac (- n 1))))) which recursively calculates the factorial of the given number. The first step is to try and determine the performance characteristic for the body of the function only in this case, nothing special is done in the body, just a multiplication (or the return of the value 1). So the performance for the body is: O(1) (constant). Next try and determine this for the number of recursive calls. In this case we have n-1 recursive calls. So the performance for the recursive calls is: O(n-1) (order is n, as we throw away the insignificant parts). Then put those two together and you then have the performance for the whole recursive function: 1 * (n-1) = O(n) Peter, to answer your raised issues; the method I describe here actually handles this quite well. But keep in mind that this is still an approximation and not a full mathematically correct answer. The method described here is also one of the methods we were taught at university, and if I remember correctly was used for far more advanced algorithms than the factorial I used in this example. Of course it all depends on how well you can estimate the running time of the body of the function and the number of recursive calls, but that is just as true for the other methods. "}

{"user":"267","questionId":"4556","creationDate":"2008-08-07T10:09:58.703","answerId":"4562","type":"answer","body":"No, it can't do that since there is no way to express constant over time for a value. If the compiler should be able to do that, there would have to be a guarantee from the code returning the value that the value is constant, and for the duration of the loop won't change. But, in this case, you're free to add new rows to the data table as part of your loop, and thus it's up to you to make that guarantee, in the way you have done it. So in short, the compiler will not do that optimization if the end-index is anything other than a variable. In the case of a variable, where the compiler can just look at the loop-code and see that this particular variable is not changed, it might do that and load the value into a register before starting the loop, but any performance gain from this would most likely be negligible, unless your loop body is empty. Conclusion: If you know, or is willing to accept, that the end loop index is constant for the duration of the loop, place it into a variable. Edit: Re-read your post, and yes, you might see negligible performance gains for your two cases as well, because the JITter optimizes the code. The JITter might optimize your end-index read into a direct access to the variable inside the data table that contains the row count, and a memory read isn't all that expensive anyway. If, on the other hand, reading that property was a very expensive operation, you'd see a more noticable difference. "}

{"user":"611","questionId":"4347","creationDate":"2008-08-07T11:24:54.997","answerId":"4597","type":"answer","body":"This is a rather broad question, as programming GUI applications in Windows can be done in so many ways. There are two main parts to developing any GUI app: the language and the API/framework. Considering you're interested in learning to build Windows GUI apps, the language isn't really a point of focus for you. Hence, you should pick a language you already know and work with a framework or API that can be harnessed by your chosen language. If you want to use C you're pretty much restricted to dealing with the Win32 API yourself, in which case reading Petzold or Richter would be great places to start. The Win32 API can be quite daunting, but it's well worth the effort to learn (imho). There are plenty of tutorials on Win32 on the web, and there's always MSDN, with a complete reference/guide to the Win32 API. Make sure you cover not just the API, but other areas such as resources/dialogs as they are building blocks for your Win32 application. If you want to use C++ you have all of the options that you have when using C plus a few others. I'd recommend going with the Win32 API directly, and then moving on to a known framework such as MFC, Qt, wxWindows or GTK so that you can spend less time working with boilerplate code and instead focus on writing your application logic. The last 3 options I just listed have the added benefit of being cross-platform, so you don't have to worry too much about platform-specific issues. Given that you said you want to work with Windows, I'll assume you're keen to focus on that rather than cross-platform -- so go with MFC, but spend some time with the Win32 API first to get familiar with some of the concepts. When dealing with MFC and the Win32 API, it's a good idea to try and get a solid understanding of the terminology prior to writing code. For example, you need to understand what the message pump is, and how it works. You need to know about concepts such as \"owner-drawn controls\", and subclassing. When you understand these things (and more), you'll find it easier to work with MFC because it uses similar terminology in its class interfaces (eg. you need to know what \"translate messages\" means before you can understand how and when to use PreTranslateMessage). You could also use Managed C++ to write .NET GUI applications, but I've read in a few places that Managed C++ wasn't really intended to be used in this manner. Instead it should be used as a gateway between native/unmanaged code and managed code. If you're using .NET it's best to use a .NET language such as VB.NET or C# to build your GUIs. So if you are going to use .NET, you currently have the choice of the WinForms library, or WPF. I personally feel that you'd be wasting time learning to build WinForms applications given that WPF is designed to replace it. Over time WPF will become more prevelant and Winforms will most likely die off. WPF has a much richer API set, and doesn't suffer from many of the limitations that Winforms does. If you do choose this route, however, you'll no doubt have to learn XAML, which is a markup language that drives WPF applications. This technology is coming of age, and there are many great places to learn about it. First, there are sites such as LearnWPF, and DrWPF which have some really great articles. Secondly, there are plenty of quality books on the topic. So, to sum up, once you've picked your language and tech, the path is actually quite easy. Just pick up a book or two, read some blogs, get into some code samples.. and most importantly ... write code. Keep writing, keep making mistakes, and keep learning from them. As a final note... In other words, Silverlight. If you don't want to go the MS route you might give Adobe's Flash/Flex a look see. Both Silverlight and Flash/Flex build RIA's. Which I think is where we are headed. They days of Office like apps are numbered I don't agree at all. Silverlight is not the same as WPF. Silverlight is web-specific, and only has a subset of WPF's features. Given that the question asks for Windows GUI apps, Flash/Flex Rich Internet Apps are not really a fitting suggestion. I also don't agree that the days of Rich Client Applications (such as office) are numbered at all. I hope that helps. Good luck :) "}

I would hardly say this is a very good solution, but it is possible anyway. What kind of code are you going to expect in that string? If it is a minor subset of valid code, for instance just math expressions, it might be that other alternatives exists. Edit: Well, that teaches me to read the questions thoroughly first. Yes, reflection would be able to give you some help here. If you split the string by the ; first, to get individual properties, you can use the following code to get a PropertyInfo object for a particular property for a class, and then use that object to manipulate a particular object.

If you can live with the risk of false positives (ie. two files which aren't 100% identical but your code says they are), then the digest and checksum algorithms can be used to lessen the work, particularly if the files lives on two different machines with less than optimal bandwidth so that a binary comparison is infeasible. The digest and checksum algorithms all have chances of false positives, but the exact chance varies with the algorithm. General rule is that the more crypto-made it is, and the more bits it outputs, the less chance of a false positive. Even the CRC-32 algorithm is fairly good to use and it should be easy to find code examples on the internet that implements it. If you only do a size/timestamp comparison then I'm sorry to say that this is easy to circumvent and won't actually give you much of a certainty that the files are the same or different.

I don't use Xming myself but there are some general phenomenon to check for. One test you can do to manually verify the DISPLAY variable is correct is: Start your VPN. Run ipconfig to be sure you have the two IP addresses you mentioned (your local IP and your VPN IP). Start Xming. Run 'netstat -n' to see how it's binding to the interface. You should see something that either says localIP:6000 or VPNIP:6000. It may not be 6000 but chances are it will be something like that. If there's no VPNIP:6000 it may be binding only to your localIP or even 127.0.0.1. That will probably not work over the VPN. Check if there are some Xming settings to make it bind to other or all interfaces. If you see VPNIP:6000 or something similar, take note of what it says and remote shell into your UNIX host (hopefully something like ssh, if not whatever you have to get a text terminal). On the UNIX terminal type 'echo $DISPLAY'. If there is nothing displayed try 'export DISPLAY=VPNIP:0.0' where VPNIP is your VPN IP address and 0.0 is the port you saw in step 3 minus 6000 with .0 at the end (i.e. 6000 = 0.0, 6010 = 10.0). On the UNIX host run something like 'xclock' or 'xterm' to see if it runs. The error message should be informative. It will tell you that it either couldn't connect to the host (a connectivity problem) or authentication failed (you'll need to coordinate Xauth on your host and local machine or Xhosts on your local machine). Opening Xhosts (with + for all hosts or something similar) isn't too bad if you have a locally protected network and you're going over a VPN. Hopefully this will get you started tracking down the problem. Another option that is often useful as it works over a VPN or simple ssh connectivity is ssh tunneling or X11 forwarding over ssh. This simulates connectivity to the X server on your local box by redirecting a port on your UNIX host to the local port on your X server box. Your display will typically be something like localhost:10.0 for the local 6010 port. X can be ornery to set up but it usually works great once you get the hang of it. "}

Thankfully this is not production ;) The problems started when the disk with the SQL Server databases and search index ran out of space. Following this, the search service would not run and search settings in the SSP were not accessible. Reclaiming the disk space did not resolve the issue. So rather than restoring the VM, we decided to try to fix the issue. We created a new SSP and changed the association of all services to the new SSP. The old SSP and it's databases were then deleted. Search results for PDF files are no longer appearing, but the search works fine otherwise. MySites also works OK.

A friend of mine at college took a graduate AI course and for his main project he wrote a \"Lights Out\" solver in Lisp. Multiple versions of his program utilized slightly different AI routines and testing on 40 or so computers yielded some pretty neat results (I wish it was online somewhere for me to link to, but I don't think it is). Two semesters ago I used Scheme (a language based on Lisp) to write an interactive program that simulated Abbott and Costello's \"Who's on First\" routine. Input from the user was matched against some pretty complicated data structures (resembling maps in other languages, but much more flexible) to choose what an appropriate response would be. I also wrote a routine to solve a 3x3 slide puzzle (an algorithm which could easily be extended to larger slide puzzles). In summary, learning Lisp (or Scheme) may not yield many practical applications beyond AI but it is an extremely valuable learning experience, as many others have stated. Programming in a functional language like Lisp will also help you think recursively (if you've had trouble with recursion in other languages, this could be a great help). "}
{"user":"462","questionId":"4519","creationDate":"2008-08-07T14:31:09.207","answerId":"4768","type":"answer","body":"You may have better luck doing X11 Forwarding through SSH rather than fiddling with your DISPLAY variable directly. X11 Forwarding with SSH is secure and uses the existing SSH connection to tunnel, so working through a VPN should be no problem. Fortunately this is fairly straightforward with Xming. If you open your connection from within Xming (e.g. the plink option) I believe it sets up X11 forwarding by default. If you connect using another SSH client (e.g. PuTTY) then you simply need to enable X11 forwarding (e.g. 'ssh -X user@host'). In PuTTY the option is under Connection -> SSH -> X11 -> click on 'Enable X11 Forwarding'. Make sure Xming is running in the background on your laptop and do the standard X test, 'xclock'. If you get a message like 'X connection to localhost:19.0 broken (explicit kill or server shutdown).' then Xming is most likely not running. Also, make sure you're not explicitly setting your DISPLAY variable in any startup scripts; SSH will set up an alias (something like localhost:10 or in the example above localhost:19) for the X11 tunnel and automatically set DISPLAY to that value. Overwriting DISPLAY will obviously mean you will no longer be pointing to the correct X11 tunnel. The flip side of this is that other terminals that don't have SSH X11 Forwarding set can use the same DISPLAY value and take advantage of the tunnel. I tend to prefer the PuTTY option but several of my coworkers use plink from within Xming. "}

To provide highlighting information on the UI, add or remove a class name that is styled via CSS based on if the item is active/selected or not.

You should switch databases when you have a reason to do so, would be my advice. If your existing database is performing to your expectations, supports the load that is being placed on it by your production systems, has the features you require in your applications and you aren't bored with it, why change? However, if you find your application isn't scaling, or you are designing an application that has high load or scalability requirements and your research tells you your current database platform is weak in that area, or, as was already mentioned, you need some spatial analysis or feature that a particular database has, well there you go. Another consideration might be taking up the use of a database agnostic ORM tool that can allow you to experiment freely with different database platforms with a simple configuration setting. That was the trigger for us to consider trying out something new in the DB department. If our application can handle any DB the ORM can handle, why pay licensing fees on a commercial database when an open source DB works just as well for the levels of performance we require? The bottom line, though, is that with databases or any other technology, I think there are no \"business rules\" that will tell you when it is time to switch - your scenario will tell you it is time to switch because something in your solution won't be quite right, and if you aren't at that point, no need to change.

Loading libA before libB should work, unless one of those libraries has a dependency that is unaccounted for and not in the path. My understanding is that once it gets to a system loadLibrary call (i.e. Java has found the library in its java.library.path and is now telling the OS to load it) - it is completely dependent on the operating system to find any dependent libraries, because at that point it is the operating system that is loading the library for the process, and the OS only knows how to look in the system path. That seems hard to set in the case of a Webstart app, but there is a way around this that does not involve static compiling. You may be able to shuffle where your libraries are - I am unsure If you use a custom classloader, you can override loadLibrary and findLibrary so that it can locate your libraries from within a jar in your classpath, and if you also make it aware of your native library dependencies (i.e. libB depends on libA depends on libX, then when loading libB you can catch yourself and ensure you load libA first, and in checking that notice and load libX first. Then the OS doesn't try to find a library that isn't in your path. It's klunky and a bit painful, but ensuring Java finds them and loads them all in the correct order can work. "}

Other useful tools are HTMLParser or sgmllib.SGMLParser which are part of the standard Python library. These work by calling methods every time you enter/exit a tag and encounter html text. They're like Expat if you're familiar with that. These libraries are especially useful if you are going to parse very large files and creating a DOM tree would be long and expensive.

I have never used Grails or Rails before, but I have used Groovy and Ruby before, and as a language I think Ruby is much cleaner and more consistent, and the team might enjoy production more. As a platform, Rails has been out longer and has a lot of attention, so I would imagine it is a more stable platform to use with more fleshed out features. JRuby has full access to classes written in Java, so this is why I would say consider trying Rails. If it is too late in the decision time to consider it then I guess you can just ignore this post.

This makes cases where you want to redirect a user to an external page, but need to post to that page for some reason (for authentication, for instance) a pain.

I started from this article on C# Corner, but found the example - while technically sound - a little incomplete. Everything he said was right, but I needed to hit a few external sites to piece this together to work exactly as I wanted. It didn't help that the user was not technically submitting a form at all; they were clicking a link to go to our support center, but to log them in an http post had to be made to the support center's site. This solution involves using HttpContext.Current.Response.Write() to write the data for the form, then using a bit of Javascript on the <body onload=\"\"> method to submit the form to the proper URL. When the user clicks on the Support Center link, the following method is called to write the response and redirect the user: public static void PassthroughAuthentication() { System.Web.HttpContext.Current.Response.Write(\"<body onload=document.forms[0].submit();window.location=\\\"Home.aspx\\\";>\"); System.Web.HttpContext.Current.Response.Write(\"<form name=\\\"Form\\\" target=_blank method=post action=\\\"https://external-url.com/security.asp\\\">\"); System.Web.HttpContext.Current.Response.Write(string.Format(\"<input type=hidden name=\\\"cFName\\\" value=\\\"{0}\\\">\", \"Username\")); System.Web.HttpContext.Current.Response.Write(\"</form>\"); System.Web.HttpContext.Current.Response.Write(\"</body>\"); } The key to this method is in that onload bit of Javascript, which , when the body of the page loads, submits the form and then redirects the user back to my own Home page. The reason for that bit of hoodoo is that I'm launching the external site in a new window, but don't want the user to resubmit the hidden form if they refresh the page. Plus that hidden form pushed the page down a few pixels which got on my nerves. I'd be very interested in any cleaner ideas anyone has on this one. Eric Sipple "}

There is no default constructor, but I want one to make the tests simpler to read. I also want to wrap the exceptions thrown from the constructor into a RuntimeException. So, what I want to do is effectively this: public class MyClassMock extends MyClass { public MyClassMock() { try { super(0); } catch (Exception e) { throw new RuntimeException(e); } } // Mocked methods } But Java complains that super isn't the first statement. My workaround: public class MyClassMock extends MyClass { public static MyClassMock construct() { try { return new MyClassMock(); } catch (Exception e) { throw new RuntimeException(e); } } public MyClassMock() throws Exception { super(0); } // Mocked methods } Is this the best workaround? Why doesn't Java let me do the former?

A bug is a defect in your program implementation. For instance, if you design your program to be able to add two numbers and give the user the sum, a defect would be that it does not handle negative numbers correctly, and thus a bug. A change request is when you have a design defect. For instance, you might have specifically said that your program should not handle negative numbers. A change request is then filed in order to redesign and thus reimplement that part. The design defect might not be intentional, but could easily be because you just didn't consider that part when you originally designed your program, or new cases that didn't exist at the time when the original design was created have been invented or discovered since. In other words, a program might operate exactly as designed, but need to be changed. This is a change request. Typically, fixing a bug is considered a much cheaper action than executing a change request, as the bug was never intended to be part of your program. The design, however, was. And thus a different workflow might be necessary to handle the two different scenarios. For instance, you might have a different way of confirming and filing bugs than you have for change requests, which might require more work to lay out the consequences of the change. "}

When you have users who are visually impaired and/or use screenreaders to view your site, you need to make sure that your site is compliant to accessibility standards. Users that use screenreaders will tend to have their own high-contrast, large-font stylesheet (if your site doesn't supply one itself) which makes it easy for screenreaders to parse the page. When a screenreader reads a page and sees a table, it'll tell the user it's a table. Hence, if you use a table for layout, it gets very confusing because the user doesn't know that the content of the table is actually the article instead of some other tabular data. A menu should be a list or a collection of divs, not a table with menu items, again that's confusing. You should make sure that you use blockquotes, alt-tags title attributes, etc to make it more readable. If you make your design CSS-driven, then your entire look and feel can be stripped away and replaced with a raw view which is very readable to those users. If you have inline styles, table-based layouts, etc, then you're making it harder for those users to parse your content. While I do feel that maintenance is made easier for some things when your site is purely laid out with CSS, I don't think it's the case for all kinds of maintenance -- especially when you're dealing with cross-browser CSS, which can obviously be a nightmare. In short, your page should describe its make-up in a standards compliant way if you want it to be accessible to said users. If you have no need/requirement and likely won't need it in the future, then don't bother wasting too much time attempting to be a CSS purist :) Use the mixture of style and layout techniques that suits you and makes your job easier.

I'd say that if the color of the home page was originally designed to be red, and for some reason it is blue, that's easily a quick fix and doesn't need to involve many people or man-hours to do the change. Just check out the file, change the color, check it back in and update the bug. However, if the color of the home page was designed to be red, and is red, but someone thinks it needs to be blue, that is, to me anyway, a different type of change. For instance, have someone thought about the impact this might have on other parts of the page, like images and logos overlaying the blue background? Could there be borders of things that looks bad? Link underlining is blue, will that show up? As an example, I am red/green color blind, changing the color of something is, for me, not something I take lightly. There are enough webpages on the web that gives me problems. Just to make a point that even the most trivial change can be nontrivial if you consider everything. The actual end implementation change is probably much of the same, but to me a change request is a different beast, precisely because it needs to be thought about more to make sure it will work as expected. A bug, however, is that someone said this is how we're going to do it and then someone did it differently. A change request is more like but we need to consider this other thing as well... hmm.... There are exceptions of course, but let me take your examples apart. If the server was designed to handle more than 300,000,000,000 pageviews, then yes, it is a bug that it doesn't. But designing a server to handle that many pageviews is more than just saying our server should handle 300,000,000,000 pageviews, it should contain a very detailed specification for how it can do that, right down to processing time guarantees and disk access average times. If the code is then implemented exactly as designed, and unable to perform as expected, then the question becomes: did we design it incorrectly or did we implement it incorrectly?. I agree that in this case, wether it is to be considered a design flaw or a implementation flaw depends on the actual reason for why it fails to live up to expectations. For instance, if someone assumed disks were 100x times as fast as they actually are, and this is deemed to be the reason for why the server fails to perform as expected, I'd say this is a design bug, and someone needs to redesign. If the original requirement of that many pageviews is still to be held, a major redesign with more in-memory data and similar might have to be undertaken. However, if someone has just failed to take into account how raid disks operate and how to correctly benefit from striped media, that's a bug and might not need that big of a change to fix. Again, there will of course be exceptions. In any case, the original difference I stated is the one I have found to be true in most cases. "}

In languages, like C++, where you can actually overload the behaviour of the && and || operators, it is highly recommended that you do not do this. This is because when you overload this behaviour, you end up forcing the evaluation of both sides of the operation. This does two things: It breaks the lazy evaluation mechanism because the overload is a function which has to be invoked, and hence both parameters are evaluated before calling the function. The order of evaluation of said parameters isn't guaranteed and can be compiler specific. Hence the objects wouldn't behave in the same manner as they do in the examples listed in the question/previous answers. For more info, have a read of Scott Meyers' book, More Effective C++. Cheers!

It's fine for blogs and concocted demos like the csszengarden, but it's a bogus benefit on any site with a moderately complex design, really. Using a CMS is far more important. DIVs plus CSS != semantic, either. Good HTML is well worthwhile for SEO and accessibility always, whether tables or CSS are used for layout. You get really efficient, fast web designs by combining really simple tables with some good CSS. Table layouts can be more accessible than CSS layouts, and the reverse is also true - it depends TOTALLY on the source order of the content, and just because you avoided tables does not mean users with screen readers will automatically have a good time on your site. Layout tables are irrelevant to screen reader access provided the content makes sense when linearised, exactly the same as if you do CSS layout. Data tables are different; they are really hard to mark up properly and even then the users of screen reader software generally don't know the commands they need to use to understand the data. Rather than agonising over using a few layout tables, you should worry that heading tags and alt text are used properly, and that form labels are properly assigned. Then you'll have a pretty good stab at real world accessibility. This from several years experience running user testing for web accessibility, specialising in accessible site design, and from consulting for Cahoot, an online bank, on this topic for a year. So my answer to the poster is no, there is no business reason to prefer CSS over tables. It's more elegant, more satisfying and more correct, but you as the person building it and the person that has to maintain it after you are the only two people in the world who give a rat's ass whether it's CSS or tables.

If you want to use the original definition of it, it might make more sense, but other than that it is mostly syntactic sugar. If you read the Wikipedia article on the subject, you'll find two conflicting notations, Systems Hungarian Notation and Apps Hungarian Notation. The original, good, definition is the Apps Hungarian Notation, but most people use the Systems Hungarian Notation. As an example of the two, consider prefixing variables with l for length, a for area and v for volume. With such notation, the following expression makes sense: int vBox = aBottom * lVerticalSide; but this doesn't: int aBottom = lSide1; If you're mixing the prefixes, they're to be considered part of the equation, and volume = area * length is fine for a box, but copying a length value into an area variable should raise some red flags. Unfortunately, the other notation is less useful, where people prefix the variable names with the type of the value, like this: int iLength; int iVolume; int iArea; some people use n for number, or i for integer, f for float, s for string etc. The original prefix was meant to be used to spot problems in equations, but has somehow devolved into making the code slightly easier to read since you don't have to go look for the variable declaration. With todays smart editors where you can simply hover over any variable to find the full type, and not just an abbreviation for it, this type of hungarian notation has lost a lot of its meaning. But, you should make up your own mind. All I can say is that I don't use either. Edit Just to add a short notice, while I don't use Hungarian Notation, I do use a prefix, and it's the underscore. I prefix all private fields of classes with a _ and otherwise spell their names as I would a property, titlecase with the first letter uppercase. "}

Some details about it are mentioned below: http://www.bloombit.com/Articles/2008/05/ASCII-Encoded-Binary-String-Automated-SQL-Injection.aspx The nasty thing about this is that effectively every varchar type field in the database is \"infected\" to spit out a reference to this URL, in which the browser gets a tiny iframe that turns it into a bot. A basic SQL fix for this can be found here: http://aspadvice.com/blogs/programming_shorts/archive/2008/06/27/Asprox-Recovery.aspx The scary thing though is that the virus looks to the system tables for values to infect and a lot of shared hosting plans also share the database space for their clients. So most likely it wasn't even your dad's site that was infected, but somebody else's site within his hosting cluster that wrote some poor code and opened the door to SQL Injection attack. If he hasn't done so yet, I'd send an URGENT e-mail to their host and give them a link to that SQL code to fix the entire system. You can fix your own affected database tables, but most likely the bots that are doing the infection are going to pass right through that hole again and infect the whole lot. Hopefully this gives you some more info to work with. EDIT: One more quick thought, if he's using one of the hosts online design tools for building his website, all of that content is probably sitting in a column and was infected that way. "}

{"user":"332","questionId":"5428","creationDate":"2008-08-07T22:56:03.883","answerId":"5456","type":"answer","body":"The Hungarian Naming Convention can be useful when used correctly, unfortunately it tends to be misused more often than not. Read Joel Spolsky's article Making Wrong Code Look Wrong for appropriate perspective and justification. Essentially, type based Hungarian notation, where variables are prefixed with information about their type (e.g. whether an object is a string, a handle, an int, etc.) is mostly useless and generally just adds overhead with very little benefit. This, sadly, is the Hungarian notation most people are familiar with. However, the intent of Hungarian notation as envisioned is to add information on the \"kind\" of data the variable contains. This allows you to partition kinds of data from other kinds of data which shouldn't be allowed to be mixed together except, possibly, through some conversion process. For example, pixel based coordinates vs. coordinates in other units, or unsafe user input versus data from safe sources, etc. Look at it this way, if you find yourself spelunking through code to find out information on a variable then you probably need to adjust your naming scheme to contain that information, this is the essence of the Hungarian convention. Note that an alternative to Hungarian notation is to use more classes to show the intent of variable usage rather than relying on primitive types everywhere. For example, instead of having variable prefixes for unsafe user input, you can have simple string wrapper class for unsafe user input, and a separate wrapper class for safe data. This has the advantage, in strongly typed languages, of having partitioning enforced by the compiler (even in less strongly typed languages you can usually add your own tripwire code) but adds a not insignificant amount of overhead.

My question is if anyone has had issues working with Community Server, skinning it and extending it?

I want to be out of the admin part of this as much as possible and didn't think there were too many engines that having multiple blogs didn't mean db work.

Some reasoning for why I don't like it for our public site are they are on different servers, it doesn't support multiple authors, there is no built in syndication, it is a little flimsy feeling to me from looking at the source and I personally think the other features of Community Server make its price tag worth it. another edit: Need to stick to .net software that run on sql server in my company's case, but I don't mind seeing recommendations for others.

I've seen some people suggest that tables should have an auto-incrementing (\"identity\") int as a clustered primary key even if it doesn't have any meaning, as it means that the database engine itself can use that value to quickly look up a row instead of having to use a bookmark. My database is merge-replicated across a bunch of servers, so I've shied away from identity int columns as they're a bit hairy to get right in replication. What are your thoughts?

{"user":"581","questionId":"5600","creationDate":"2008-08-08T03:04:29.047","answerId":"5607","type":"answer","body":"When dealing with indexes, you have to determine what your table is going to be used for. If you are primarily inserting 1000 rows a second and not doing any querying, then a clustered index is a hit to performance. If you are doing 1000 queries a second, then not having an index will lead to very bad performance. The best thing to do when trying to tune queries/indexes is to use the Query Plan Analyzer and SQL Profiler in SQL Server. This will show you where you are running into costly table scans or other performance blockers. As for the GUID vs ID argument, you can find people online that swear by both. I have always been taught to use GUIDs unless I have a really good reason not to. Jeff has a good post that talks about the reasons for using GUIDs: http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000817.html. As with most anything development related, if you are looking to improve performance there is not one, single right answer. It really depends on what you are trying to accomplish and how you are implementing the solution. The only true answer is to test, test, and test again against performance metrics to ensure that you are meeting your goals. [Edit] @Matt, after doing some more research on the GUID/ID debate I came across this post. Like I mentioned before, there is not a true right or wrong answer. It depends on your specific implementation needs. But these are some pretty valid reasons to use GUIDs as the primary key: For example, there is an issue known as a \"hotspot\", where certain pages of data in a table are under relatively high currency contention. Basically, what happens is most of the traffic on a table (and hence page-level locks) occurs on a small area of the table, towards the end. New records will always go to this hotspot, because IDENTITY is a sequential number generator. These inserts are troublesome because they require Exlusive page lock on the page they are added to (the hotspot). This effectively serializes all inserts to a table thanks to the page locking mechanism. NewID() on the other hand does not suffer from hotspots. Values generated using the NewID() function are only sequential for short bursts of inserts (where the function is being called very quickly, such as during a multi-row insert), which causes the inserted rows to spread randomly throughout the table's data pages instead of all at the end - thus eliminating a hotspot from inserts. Also, because the inserts are randomly distributed, the chance of page splits is greatly reduced. While a page split here and there isnt too bad, the effects do add up quickly. With IDENTITY, page Fill Factor is pretty useless as a tuning mechanism and might as well be set to 100% - rows will never be inserted in any page but the last one. With NewID(), you can actually make use of Fill Factor as a performance-enabling tool. You can set Fill Factor to a level that approximates estimated volume growth between index rebuilds, and then schedule the rebuilds during off-peak hours using dbcc reindex. This effectively delays the performance hits of page splits until off-peak times. If you even think you might need to enable replication for the table in question - then you might as well make the PK a uniqueidentifier and flag the guid field as ROWGUIDCOL. Replication will require a uniquely valued guid field with this attribute, and it will add one if none exists. If a suitable field exists, then it will just use the one thats there. Yet another huge benefit for using GUIDs for PKs is the fact that the value is indeed guaranteed unique - not just among all values generated by this server, but all values generated by all computers - whether it be your db server, web server, app server, or client machine. Pretty much every modern language has the capability of generating a valid guid now - in .NET you can use System.Guid.NewGuid. This is VERY handy when dealing with cached master-detail datasets in particular. You dont have to employ crazy temporary keying schemes just to relate your records together before they are committed. You just fetch a perfectly valid new Guid from the operating system for each new record's permanent key value at the time the record is created. http://forums.asp.net/t/264350.aspx "}

This is done for a site that uses a secure connection (HTTPS). The technology used here is PLSQL and the DOJO JavaScript library. The development tool is basically a text editor. Code Snippet: > function testPost() { >> dojo.xhrPost( { url: ''dr_tm_w_0120.test_post'', form: ''orgForm'', load: testPostXHRCallback, error: testPostXHRError }); } > function testPostXHRCallback(data,ioArgs) { >> alert(''post callback''); try{ dojo.byId(\"messageDiv\").innerHTML = data; } catch(ex){ if(ex.name == \"TypeError\") { alert(\"A type error occurred.\"); } } return data; } > function testPostXHRError(data, ioArgs) { >> alert(data); alert(''Error when retrieving data from the server!''); return data; } The Problem: When using IE6 (which the entire user-base uses), the response sent back from the server is a 404 error. Observations: The program works fine in Firefox. The calling procedure cannot target any procedures within the same package. The calling procedure can target outside sites (both http, https). The other AJAX calls in the package that are not posts of form data work fine. I've searched the internets and consulted with senior-skilled team members and haven't discovered anything that satisfactorily addresses the issue. *Tried Q&A over at Dojo support forums. The Questions: What troubleshooting techniques do you recommend? What troubleshooting tools do you recommend for HTTPS analyzing? Any hypotheses on what the issue might be? Any ideas for workarounds that aren't total (bad) hacks? Ed. The Solution lomaxx, thx for the fiddler tip. you have no idea how awesome it was to get that and use it as a debugging tool. after starting it up this is what i found and how i fixed it (at least in the short term): > ef Fri, 8 Aug 2008 14:01:26 GMT dr_tm_w_0120.test_post: SIGNATURE (parameter names) MISMATCH VARIABLES IN FORM NOT IN PROCEDURE: SO1_DISPLAYED_,PO1_DISPLAYED_,RWA2_DISPLAYED_,DD1_DISPLAYED_ NON-DEFAULT VARIABLES IN PROCEDURE NOT IN FORM: 0 After seeing that message from the server, I kicked around Fiddler a bit more to see what else I could learn from it. Found that there's a WebForms tab that shows the values in the web form. Wouldn't you know it, the \"xxx_DISPLAYED_\" fields above were in it. I don't really understand yet why these fields exist, because I didn't create them explicitly in the web PLSQL code. But I do understand now that the target procedure has to include them as parameters to work correctly. Again, this is only in the case of IE6 for me, as Firefox worked fine. Well, that the short term answer and hack to fix it. Hopefully, a little more work in this area will lead to a better understanding of the fundamentals going on here. "}

This tells me that some conversion was done at some point improperly. The only problem with UTF8 is that there isn't a standardized way to recognize that a file is UTF8, and until all editors are standardizing on UTF8, there will still be conversion errors. For other unicode variants, a Byte Order Mark (BOM) is fairly standard to help identify a file, but BOMs in UTF8 files are pretty rare. To keep it from showing up in your content, make sure you're always using unicode-aware editors, and make sure that you always open your files with the proper encodings.

Fowler has broken the pattern into two - Passive View and Supervising Controller. When using Passive View, your View typically implement a fine-grained interface with properties mapping more or less directly to the underlaying UI widget. For instance, you might have a ICustomerView with properties like Name and Address. Your implementation might look something like this: public class CustomerView : ICustomerView { public string Name { get { return txtName.Text; } set { txtName.Text = value; } } } Your Presenter class will talk to the model and \"map\" it to the view. This approach is called the \"Passive View\". The benefit is that the view is easy to test, and it is easier to move between UI platforms (Web, Windows/XAML, etc.). The disadvantage is that you can't leverage things like databinding (which is really powerful in frameworks like WPF and Silverlight). The second flavor of MVP is the Supervising Controller. In that case your View might have a property called Customer, which then again is databound to the UI widgets. You don't have to think about synchronizing and micro-manage the view, and the Supervising Controller can step in and help when needed, for instance with compled interaction logic. The third \"flavor\" of MVP (or someone would perhaps call it a separate pattern) is the Presentation Model (or sometimes referred to Model-View-ViewModel). Compared to the MVP you \"merge\" the M and the P into one class. You have your customer object which your UI widgets is data bound to, but you also have additional UI-spesific fields like \"IsButtonEnabled\", or \"IsReadOnly\", etc. I think the best resource I've found to UI architecture is the series of blog posts done by Jeremy Miller over at The Build Your Own CAB Series Table of Contents. He covered all the flavors of MVP and showed C# code to implement them. I have also blogged about the Model-View-ViewModel pattern in the context of Silverlight over at YouCard Re-visited: Implementing the ViewModel pattern. "}

There isn't an existing parallel you can draw without understanding how memory is physically laid out within a computer, and no one thinks about this kind of thing until they're dealing with low level things - at the C/C++/byte communications level. Are there any tools or thought processes that helped you understand how pointers work at the variable, function, and beyond level? Addresses boxes. I remember when I was learning to program BASIC into microcomputers, there were these pretty books with games in them, and sometimes you had to poke values into particular addresses. They had a picture of a bunch of boxes, incrementally labelled with 0, 1, 2... and it was explained that only one small thing (a byte) could fit in these boxes, and there were a lot of them - some computers had as many as 65535! They were next to each other, and they all had an address. What are some good practice things that can be done to bring somebody to the level of, \"Ah-hah, I got it,\" without getting them bogged down in the overall concept? Basically, drill like scenarios. For a drill? Make a struct: struct { char a; char b; char c; char d; } mystruct; mystruct.a = 'r'; mystruct.b = 's'; mystruct.c = 't'; mystruct.d = 'u'; char* my_pointer; my_pointer = &mystruct.b; cout << 'Start: my_pointer = ' << *my_pointer << endl; my_pointer++; cout << 'After: my_pointer = ' << *my_pointer << endl; my_pointer = &mystruct.a; cout << 'Then: my_pointer = ' << *my_pointer << endl; my_pointer = my_pointer + 3; cout << 'End: my_pointer = ' << *my_pointer << endl; Same example as above, except in C: // Same example as above, except in C: struct { char a; char b; char c; char d; } mystruct; mystruct.a = 'r'; mystruct.b = 's'; mystruct.c = 't'; mystruct.d = 'u'; char* my_pointer; my_pointer = &mystruct.b; printf(\"Start: my_pointer = %c\\n\", *my_pointer); my_pointer++; printf(\"After: my_pointer = %c\\n\", *my_pointer); my_pointer = &mystruct.a; printf(\"Then: my_pointer = %c\\n\", *my_pointer); my_pointer = my_pointer + 3; printf(\"End: my_pointer = %c\\n\", *my_pointer); Output: Start: my_pointer = s After: my_pointer = t Then: my_pointer = r End: my_pointer = u Perhaps that explains some of the basics through example?

{"user":"267","questionId":"5727","creationDate":"2008-08-08T06:58:48.700","answerId":"5754","type":"answer","body":"Pointers is a concept that for many can be confusing at first, in particular when it comes to copying pointer values around and still referencing the same memory block. I've found that the best analogy is to consider the pointer as a piece of paper with a house address on it, and the memory block it references as the actual house. All sorts of operations can thus be easily explained. I've added some Delphi code down below, and some comments where appropriate. I chose Delphi since my other main programming language, C#, does not exhibit things like memory leaks in the same way. If you only wish to learn the high-level concept of pointers, then you should ignore the parts labelled \"Memory layout\" in the explanation below. They are intended to give examples of what memory could look like after operations, but they are more low-level in nature. However, in order to accurately explain how buffer overruns really work, it was important that I added these diagrams. Disclaimer: For all intents and purposes, this explanation and the example memory layouts are vastly simplified. There's more overhead and a lot more details you would need to know if you need to deal with memory on a low-level basis. However, for the intents of explaining memory and pointers, it is accurate enough. Let's assume the THouse class used below looks like this: type THouse = class private FName : array[0..9] of Char; public constructor Create(name: PChar); end; When you initialize the house object, the name given to the constructor is copied into the private field FName. There is a reason it is defined as a fixed-size array. In memory, there will be some overhead associated with the house allocation, I'll illustrate this below like this: ---[ttttNNNNNNNNNN]--- ^ ^ | | | +- the FName array | +- overhead The \"tttt\" area is overhead, there will typically be more of this for various types of runtimes and languages, like 8 or 12 bytes. It is imperative that whatever values are stored in this area never gets changed by anything other than the memory allocator or the core system routines, or you risk crashing the program. Allocate memory Get an entrepreneur to build your house, and give you the address to the house. In contrast to the real world, memory allocation cannot be told where to allocate, but will find a suitable spot with enough room, and report back the address to the allocated memory. In other words, the entrepreneur will choose the spot. THouse.Create('My house'); Memory layout: ---[ttttNNNNNNNNNN]--- 1234My house Keep a variable with the address Write the address to your new house down on a piece of paper. This paper will serve as your reference to your house. Without this piece of paper, you're lost, and cannot find the house, unless you're already in it. var h: THouse; begin h := THouse.Create('My house'); ... Memory layout: h v ---[ttttNNNNNNNNNN]--- 1234My house Copy pointer value Just write the address on a new piece of paper. You now have two pieces of paper that will get you to the same house, not two separate houses. Any attempts to follow the address from one paper and rearrange the furniture at that house will make it seem that the other house has been modified in the same manner, unless you can explicitly detect that it's actually just one house. Note This is usually the concept that I have the most problem explaining to people, two pointers does not mean two objects or memory blocks. var h1, h2: THouse; begin h1 := THouse.Create('My house'); h2 := h1; // copies the address, not the house ... h1 v ---[ttttNNNNNNNNNN]--- 1234My house ^ h2 Freeing the memory Demolish the house. You can then later on reuse the paper for a new address if you so wish, or clear it to forget the address to the house that no longer exists. var h: THouse; begin h := THouse.Create('My house'); ... h.Free; h := nil; Here I first construct the house, and get hold of its address. Then I do something to the house (use it, the ... code, left as an exercise for the reader), and then I free it. Lastly I clear the address from my variable. Memory layout: h <--+ v +- before free ---[ttttNNNNNNNNNN]--- | 1234My house <--+ h (now points nowhere) <--+ +- after free ---------------------- | (note, memory might still xx34My house <--+ contain some data) Dangling pointers You tell your entrepreneur to destroy the house, but you forget to erase the address from your piece of paper. When later on you look at the piece of paper, you've forgotten that the house is no longer there, and goes to visit it, with failed results (see also the part about an invalid reference below). var h: THouse; begin h := THouse.Create('My house'); ... h.Free; ... // forgot to clear h here h.OpenFrontDoor; // will most likely fail Using h after the call to .Free might work, but that is just pure luck. Most likely it will fail, at a customers place, in the middle of a critical operation. h <--+ v +- before free ---[ttttNNNNNNNNNN]--- | 1234My house <--+ h <--+ v +- after free ---------------------- | xx34My house <--+ As you can see, h still points to the remnants of the data in memory, but since it might not be complete, using it as before might fail. Memory leak You lose the piece of paper and cannot find the house. The house is still standing somewhere though, and when you later on want to construct a new house, you cannot reuse that spot. var h: THouse; begin h := THouse.Create('My house'); h := THouse.Create('My house'); // uh-oh, what happened to our first house? ... h.Free; h := nil; Here we overwrote the contents of the h variable with the address of a new house, but the old one is still standing... somewhere. After this code, there is no way to reach that house, and it will be left standing. In other words, the allocated memory will stay allocated until the application closes, at which point the operating system will tear it down. Memory layout after first allocation: h v ---[ttttNNNNNNNNNN]--- 1234My house Memory layout after second allocation: h v ---[ttttNNNNNNNNNN]---[ttttNNNNNNNNNN] 1234My house 5678My house A more common way to get this method is just to forget to free something, instead of overwriting it as above. In Delphi terms, this will occur with the following method: procedure OpenTheFrontDoorOfANewHouse; var h: THouse; begin h := THouse.Create('My house'); h.OpenFrontDoor; // uh-oh, no .Free here, where does the address go? end; After this method has executed, there's no place in our variables that the address to the house exists, but the house is still out there. Memory layout: h <--+ v +- before losing pointer ---[ttttNNNNNNNNNN]--- | 1234My house <--+ h (now points nowhere) <--+ +- after losing pointer ---[ttttNNNNNNNNNN]--- | 1234My house <--+ As you can see, the old data is left intact in memory, and will not be reused by the memory allocator. The allocator keeps track of which areas of memory has been used, and will not reuse them unless you free it. Freeing the memory but keeping a (now invalid) reference Demolish the house, erase one of the pieces of paper but you also have another piece of paper with the old address on it, when you go to the address, you won't find a house, but you might find something that resembles the ruins of one. Perhaps you will even find a house, but it is not the house you were originally given the address to, and thus any attempts to use it as though it belongs to you might fail horribly. Sometimes you might even find that a neighbouring address has a rather big house set up on it that occupies three address (Main Street 1-3), and your address goes to the middle of the house. Any attempts to treat that part of the large 3-address house as a single small house might also fail horribly. var h1, h2: THouse; begin h1 := THouse.Create('My house'); h2 := h1; // copies the address, not the house ... h1.Free; h1 := nil; h2.OpenFrontDoor; // uh-oh, what happened to our house? Here the house was torn down, through the reference in h1, and while h1 was cleared as well, h2 still has the old, out-of-date, address. Access to the house that is no longer standing might or might not work. This is a variation of the dangling pointer above. See its memory layout. Buffer overrun You move more stuff into the house than you can possibly fit, spilling into the neighbours house or yard. When the owner of that neighbouring house later on comes home, he'll find all sorts of things he'll consider his own. This is the reason I chose a fixed-size array. To set the stage, assume that the second house we allocate will, for some reason, be placed before the first one in memory. In other words, the second house will have a lower address than the first one. Also, they're allocated right next to each other. Thus, this code: var h1, h2: THouse; begin h1 := THouse.Create('My house'); h2 := THouse.Create('My other house somewhere'); ^-----------------------^ longer than 10 characters 0123456789 <-- 10 characters Memory layout after first allocation: h1 v -----------------------[ttttNNNNNNNNNN] 5678My house Memory layout after second allocation: h2 h1 v v ---[ttttNNNNNNNNNN]----[ttttNNNNNNNNNN] 1234My other house somewhereouse ^---+--^ | +- overwritten The part that will most often cause crash is when you overwrite important parts of the data you stored that really should not be randomly changed. For instance it might not be a problem that parts of the name of the h1-house was changed, in terms of crashing the program, but overwriting the overhead of the object will most likely crash when you try to use the broken object, as will overwriting links that is stored to other objects in the object. Linked lists When you follow an address on a piece of paper, you get to a house, and at that house there is another piece of paper with a new address on it, for the next house in the chain, and so on. var h1, h2: THouse; begin h1 := THouse.Create('Home'); h2 := THouse.Create('Cabin'); h1.NextHouse := h2; Here we create a link from our home house to our cabin. We can follow the chain until a house has no NextHouse reference, which means it's the last one. To visit all our houses, we could use the following code: var h1, h2: THouse; h: THouse; begin h1 := THouse.Create('Home'); h2 := THouse.Create('Cabin'); h1.NextHouse := h2; ... h := h1; while h <> nil do begin h.LockAllDoors; h.CloseAllWindows; h := h.NextHouse; end; Memory layout (added NextHouse as a link in the object, noted with the four LLLL's in the below diagram): h1 h2 v v ---[ttttNNNNNNNNNNLLLL]----[ttttNNNNNNNNNNLLLL] 1234Home + 5678Cabin + | ^ | +--------+ * (no link) In basic terms, what is a memory address? A memory address is in basic terms just a number. If you think of memory as a big array of bytes, the very first byte has the address 0, the next one the address 1 and so on upwards. This is simplified, but good enough. So this memory layout: h1 h2 v v ---[ttttNNNNNNNNNN]---[ttttNNNNNNNNNN] 1234My house 5678My house Might have these two address (the leftmost - is address 0): h1 = 4 h2 = 23 Which means that our linked list above might actuall look like this: h1 (=4) h2 (=28) v v ---[ttttNNNNNNNNNNLLLL]----[ttttNNNNNNNNNNLLLL] 1234Home 0028 5678Cabin 0000 | ^ | +--------+ * (no link) It is typical to store an address that \"points nowhere\" as a zero-address. In basic terms, what is a pointer? A pointer is just a variable holding a memory address. You can typically ask the programming language to give you its number, but most programming languages and runtimes tries to hide the fact that there is a number beneath, just because the number itself does not really hold any meaning to you. It is best to think of a pointer as a black box, ie. you don't really know or care about how it is actually implemented, just as long as it works. "}

Xcode is a suite of tools, only one of which is the IDE, so you don't have to use it if you don't want to. (That said, if there are specific things you find clunky, please file a bug at Apple's bug reporter - every bug goes to engineering.) Furthermore, installing Xcode will install both the Netwide Assembler (NASM) and the GNU Assembler (GAS); that will let you use whatever assembly syntax you're most comfortable with. You'll also want to take a look at the Compiler & Debugging Guides, because those document the calling conventions used for the various architectures that Mac OS X runs on, as well as how the binary format and the loader work. The IA-32 (x86-32) calling conventions in particular may be slightly different from what you're used to. Another thing to keep in mind is that the system call interface on Mac OS X is different from what you might be used to on DOS/Windows, Linux, or the other BSD flavors. System calls aren't considered a stable API on Mac OS X; instead, you always go through libSystem. That will ensure you're writing code that's portable from one release of the OS to the next. Finally, keep in mind that Mac OS X runs across a pretty wide array of hardware - everything from the 32-bit Core Single through the high-end quad-core Xeon. By coding in assembly you might not be optimizing as much as you think; what's optimal on one machine may be pessimal on another. Apple regularly measures its compilers and tunes their output with the \"-Os\" optimization flag to be decent across its line, and there are extensive vector/matrix-processing libraries that you can use to get high performance with hand-tuned CPU-specific implementations. Going to assembly for fun is great. Going to assembly for speed is not for the faint of heart these days. "}

The most naive algorithm I have made, which only works for files that can be kept in memory, is as follows: Grab the first four bytes from the old file, call this the key Add those bytes to a dictionary, where key -> position, where position is the position where I grabbed those 4 bytes, 0 to begin with Skip the first of these four bytes, grab another 4 (3 overlap, 1 one), and add to the dictionary the same way Repeat steps 1-3 for all 4-byte blocks in the old file From the start of the new file, grab 4 bytes, and attempt to look it up in the dictionary If found, find the longest match if there are several, by comparing bytes from the two files Encode a reference to that location in the old file, and skip the matched block in the new file If not found, encode 1 byte from the new file, and skip it Repeat steps 5-8 for the rest of the new file This is somewhat like compression, without windowing, so it will use a lot of memory. It is, however, fairly fast, and produces quite small patches, as long as I try to make the codes output minimal. A more memory-efficient algorithm uses windowing, but produces much bigger patch files. There are more nuances to the above algorithm that I skipped in this post, but I can post more details if necessary. I do, however, feel that I need a different algorithm altogether, so improving on the above algorithm is probably not going to get me far enough. Edit #1: Here is a more detailed description of the above algorithm. First, combine the two files, so that you have one big file. Remember the cut-point between the two files. Secondly, do that grab 4 bytes and add their position to the dictionary step for everything in the whole file. Thirdly, from where the new file starts, do the loop with attempting to locate an existing combination of 4 bytes, and find the longest match. Make sure we only consider positions from the old file, or from earlier in the new file than we're currently at. This ensures that we can reuse material in both the old and the new file during patch application. Edit #2: Source code to the above algorithm You might get a warning about the certificate having some problems. I don't know how to resolve that so for the time being just accept the certificate. The source uses lots of other types from the rest of my library so that file isn't all it takes, but that's the algorithm implementation. @lomaxx, I have tried to find a good documentation for the algorithm used in subversion, called xdelta, but unless you already know how the algorithm works, the documents I've found fail to tell me what I need to know. Or perhaps I'm just dense... :) I took a quick peek on the algorithm from that site you gave, and it is unfortunately not usable. A comment from the binary diff file says: Finding an optimal set of differences requires quadratic time relative to the input size, so it becomes unusable very quickly. My needs aren't optimal though, so I'm looking for a more practical solution. Thanks for the answer though, added a bookmark to his utilities if I ever need them. Edit #1: Note, I will look at his code to see if I can find some ideas, and I'll also send him an email later with questions, but I've read that book he references and though the solution is good for finding optimal solutions, it is impractical in use due to the time requirements. Edit #2: I'll definitely hunt down the python xdelta implementation. "}

{"user":"Pall Melsted","questionId":"3255","creationDate":"2008-08-08T13:53:20.930","answerId":"5943","type":"answer","body":"Big O notation is useful because it's easy to work with and hides unnecessary complications and details (for some definition of unnecessary). One nice way of working out the complexity of divide and conquer algorithms is the tree method. Let's say you have a version of quicksort with the median procedure, so you split the array into perfectly balanced subarrays every time. Now build a tree corresponding to all the arrays you work with. At the root you have the original array, the root has two children which are the subarrays. Repeat this until you have single element arrays at the bottom. Since we can find the median in O(n) time and split the array in two parts in O(n) time, the work done at each node is O(k) where k is the size of the array. Each level of the tree contains (at most) the entire array so the work per level is O(n) (the sizes of the subarrays add up to n, and since we have O(k) per level we can add this up). There are only log(n) levels in the tree since each time we halve the input. Therefore we can upper bound the amount of work by O(n*log(n)). However, Big O hides some details which we sometimes can't ignore. Consider computing the Fibonacci sequence with a=0; b=1; for (i = 0; i <n; i++) { tmp = b; b = a + b; a = tmp; } and lets just assume the a and b are BigIntegers in Java or something that can handle arbitrarily large numbers. Most people would say this is an O(n) algorithm without flinching. The reasoning is that you have n iterations in the for loop and O(1) work in side the loop. But Fibonacci numbers are large, the n-th Fibonacci number is exponential in n so just storing it will take on the order of n bytes. Performing addition with big integers will take O(n) amount of work. So the total amount of work done in this procedure is 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n(n-1)/2 = O(n^2) So this algorithm runs in quadradic time! "}

But when using a REST or Rails-like URL scheme for object instances, I'd then end up with URLs like this: http://example.com/user/783 And then the assumption is that there are also users with IDs of 782, 781, ..., 2, and 1. Assuming that the web app in question is secure enough to prevent people entering other numbers to view other users without authorization, a simple sequentially-assigned surrogate key also \"leaks\" the total number of instances (older than this one), in this case users, which might be privileged information. (For instance, I am user #726 in stackoverflow.) Would a UUID/GUID be a better solution? Then I could set up URLs like this: http://example.com/user/035a46e0-6550-11dd-ad8b-0800200c9a66 Not exactly succinct, but there's less implied information about users on display. Sure, it smacks of \"security through obscurity\" which is no substitute for proper security, but it seems at least a little more secure. Is that benefit worth the cost and complexity of implementing UUIDs for web-addressable object instances? I think that I'd still want to use integer columns as database PKs just to speed up joins. There's also the question of in-database representation of UUIDs. I know MySQL stores them as 36-character strings. Postgres seems to have a more efficient internal representation (128 bits?) but I haven't tried it myself. Anyone have any experience with this? Update: for those who asked about just using the user name in the URL (e.g., http://example.com/user/yukondude), that works fine for object instances with names that are unique, but what about the zillions of web app objects that can really only be identified by number?

I originally used a extended Dict() that automatically created sub-dicts (so you could do x[1][2][3][4] = \"something\" without having to do if x[1].has_key(2): x[1][2] = [] and so on) Then I just stored the data by doing self.data[show_id][season_number][episode_number][attribute_name] = \"something\" This worked okay, but there was no easy way of checking if x[3][24] was supposed to exist or not (so I couldn't raise the season_not_found exception). Currently it's using four classes: ShowContainer, Show, Season and Episode. Each one is a very basic dict, which I can easily add extra functionality in (the search() function on Show() for example). Each has a __setitem__, __getitem_ and has_key. This works mostly fine, I can check in Shows if it has that season in it's self.data dict, if not, raise season_not_found. I can also check in Season() if it has that episode and so on. The problem now is it's presenting itself as a dict, but doesn't have all the functionality, and because I'm overriding the __getitem__ and __setitem__ functions, it's easy to accidentally recursively call __getitem__ (so I'm not sure if extending the Dict class will cause problems). The other slight problem is adding data into the dict is a lot more work than the old Dict method (which was self.data[seas_no][ep_no]['attribute'] = 'something'). See _setItem and _setData. It's not too bad, since it's currently only a read-only API interface (so the users of the API should only ever retrieve data, not add more), but it's hardly... Elegant. I think the series-of-classes system is probably the best way, but does anyone have a better idea for storing the data? And would extending the ShowContainer/etc classes with Dict cause problems? "}

The reason is that when using NEWID() the value generated is not sequential.

For the most part, I don't use them; however, I work with code every day that includes regions - some people go really heavy on them (folding up private methods into a region and then each method folded into its own region), and some people go light on them (folding up enums, folding up attributes, etc). My general rule of thumb, as of now, is that I only put code in regions if (a) the data is likely to remain static or will not be touched very often (like enums), or (b) if there are methods that are implemented out of necessity because of subclassing or abstract method implementation, but, again, won't be touched very often.

A Form is an object whose responsibility is to present UI to the user and accept input. The interface between the Form object and other areas of the code should be a data-oriented interface, not an interface which exposes the inner implementation details of the Form. The inner workings of the Form (ie, the controls) should remain hidden from any consuming code. A mature solution would probably involve the following design points: Public methods or properties are behavior (show, hide, position) or data-oriented (set data, get data, update data). All event handlers implemented by the Form are wrapped in appropriate thread delegation code to enforce Form thread-execution rules. Controls themselves would be data-bound to the underlying data structure (where appropriate) to reduce code. And that's not even mentioning meta-development things like unit tests. "}

RESTful web services do not not use WSDL because the service can't be described by it, and the feeling is that REST is simpler and easier to understand. Some people have proposed WADL as a way to describe REST services. Languages like Python, Ruby and PHP make it easier to work with REST. the WSDL is used to generate C# code (a web service proxy) that can be easily called from a static language. This happens when you add a Service Reference or Web Reference in Visual Studio. Whether you provide SOAP or REST services depends on your user population. Whether the services are to be used over the internet or just inside your organization affects your choice. SOAP may have some features (WS-* standards) that work well for B2B or internal use, but suck for an internet service. Document/literal versus RPC for SOAP services are described on this IBM DevelopWorks article. Document/literal is generally considered the best to use in terms of interoperability (Java to .NET etc). As to whether it is easier to support, that depends on your circumstances. My personal view is that people tend to make this stuff more complicated than it needs to be, and REST's simpler approach is superior. "}

The DLL currently has the database connection string hard coded, but I don't want to do this when we launch as the assembly can be disassembled and the username and password would be right there in the open. One of the requirements is that the password needs to be changed once every few months, so we would need to roll that out to our internal user base. Is there a way to store the password encrypted in such a way we can easily distribute to the entire user base without storing it in the assembly? UPDATE: Thanks to everyone who's answered.

Compare each CompanyName to each LocationName and come up with a match score (use Levenshtein or some other string matching algo). Store the result in a separate table.

That would avoid a fair bit of text duplication in this table (over 18,000 rows, an integer foreign key would save quite a bit of space over a varchar column). But you're still faced with a method for loading that Company table and then properly associating it with the rows in Location. There's no general solution, but you could do something along these lines: Create the Company table, with an id column that auto-increments (depends on your RDBMS). Find all of the unique company names and insert them into Company. Add a column, company_id, to Location that accepts NULLs (for now) and that is a foreign key of the Company.id column. For each row in Location, determine the corresponding company, and UPDATE that row's company_id column with that company's id. This is likely the most challenging step. If your data is like what you show in the example, you'll likely have to take many runs at this with various string matching approaches. Once all rows in Location have a company_id value, then you can ALTER the Company table to add a NOT NULL constraint to the company_id column (assuming that every location must have a company, which seems reasonable). If you can make a copy of your Location table, you can gradually build up a series of SQL statements to populate the company_id foreign key. If you make a mistake, you can just start over and rerun the script up to the point of failure. "}

This is no more dangerous or critical than the normal odd file problem, and can be because of various problems, like a subversion program dying mid-change, power-disruption, etc. Unless it happens more I wouldn't make much out of it. It can be fixed by doing what you did, make a copy of your work-files, check out a fresh copy, and add the modified files back in. Note that this might cause problems if you have a busy project where you would normally have to merge in changes. For instance, you and a collegue both check out a fresh copy, and start working on the same file. At some point, your collegue checks in his modifications. When you attempt to do the same, you get the checksum problem you have. If you now make copies of your changed files, do a fresh checkout, then subversion will lose track of how your changes should be merged back in. If you didn't get the problem in this case, when you got around to checkin in your modifications, you would need to update your working copy first, and possibly handle a conflict with your file. However, if you do a fresh checkout, complete with your collegues changes, it now looks like you removed his changes and substituted with your own. No conflicts, and no indications from subversion that something is amiss. "}

So for example, if you have a method that does something, but there are certain conditions where it shouldn't do something, rather than: public void doSomething() { if (condition1 && condition2 && condition3 && condition4) { // do something } } You could change it to: public void doSomething() { if (!condition1) { return; } if (!condition2) { return; } if (!condition3) { return; } if (!condition4) { return; } // do something } It's a bit more verbose, but a lot more readable, especially when you start having weird nesting, the guard can help (combined with extracting methods).

Consider creating a helper method to abstract some of the complexity away: /// <Summary> /// Tests whether all the conditions are appropriately met /// </Summary> private bool AreAllConditionsMet ( bool var1, bool var2, bool var3, bool var4, bool var5, bool var6) { return ( var1 && // Explanation of the check var2 && // Explanation of the check var3 && // Explanation of the check var4 && // Explanation of the check var5 && // Explanation of the check var6); // Explanation of the check } private void SomeMethod() { // Do some stuff (including declare the required variables) if (AreAllConditionsMet (var1, var2, var3, var4, var5, var6)) { // Do something } } Now when visually scanning the \"SomeMethod\" method, the actual complexity of the test logic is hidden but the semantic meaning is preserved for humans to understand at a high-level. If the developer really needs to understand the details, the AreAllConditionsMet method can be examined. This is formally known as the \"Decompose Conditional\" refactoring pattern I think. Tools like Resharper or Refactor Pro! can making doing this kind of refactoring easy! In all cases, the key to having readable and understandable code is to use realistic variable names.

{"user":"756","questionId":"6184","creationDate":"2008-08-08T17:35:40.937","answerId":"6189","type":"answer","body":"Here are the salient points: You can't make UI control calls from a different thread than the one they were created on (the form's thread). Delegate invocations (ie, event hooks) are triggered on the same thread as the object that is firing the event. So, if you have a separate \"engine\" thread doing some work and have some UI watching for state changes which can be reflected in the UI (such as a progress bar or whatever), you have a problem. The engine fire's an object changed event which has been hooked by the Form. But the callback delegate that the Form registered with the engine gets called on the engine's thread\u2026 not on the Form's thread. And so you can't update any controls from that callback. Doh! BeginInvoke comes to the rescue. Just use this simple coding model in all your callback methods and you can be sure that things are going to be okay: private delegate void EventArgsDelegate(object sender, EventArgs ea); void SomethingHappened(object sender, EventArgs ea) { // // Make sure this callback is on the correct thread // if (this.InvokeRequired) { this.Invoke(new EventArgsDelegate(SomethingHappened), new object[] { sender, ea }); return; } // // Do something with the event such as update a control // textBox1.Text = \"Something happened\"; } It's quite simple really. Use InvokeRequired to find out if this callback happened on the correct thread. If not, then reinvoke the callback on the correct thread with the same parameters. You can reinvoke a method by using the Invoke (blocking) or BeginInvoke (non-blocking) methods. The next time the function is called, InvokeRequired returns false because we are now on the correct thread and everybody is happy. This is a very compact way of addressing this problem and making your Forms safe from multi-threaded event callbacks. "}
{"user":"419","questionId":"5349","creationDate":"2008-08-08T17:37:02.743","answerId":"6192","type":"answer","body":"This question used to be in the official FAQ What are some limits in memcached I might hit? (Wayback Machine) To quote: The simple limits you will probably see with memcache are the key and item size limits. Keys are restricted to 250 characters. Stored data cannot exceed 1 megabyte in size, since that is the largest typical slab size.\" The FAQ has now been revised and there are now two separate questions covering this: What is the maxiumum key length? (250 bytes) The maximum size of a key is 250 characters. Note this value will be less if you are using client \"prefixes\" or similar features, since the prefix is tacked onto the front of the original key. Shorter keys are generally better since they save memory and use less bandwidth. Why are items limited to 1 megabyte in size? Ahh, this is a popular question! Short answer: Because of how the memory allocator's algorithm works. Long answer: Memcached's memory storage engine (which will be pluggable/adjusted in the future...), uses a slabs approach to memory management. Memory is broken up into slabs chunks of varying sizes, starting at a minimum number and ascending by a factorial up to the largest possible value. Say the minimum value is 400 bytes, and the maximum value is 1 megabyte, and the factorial is 1.20: slab 1 - 400 bytes slab 2 - 480 bytes slab 3 - 576 bytes ... etc. The larger the slab, the more of a gap there is between it and the previous slab. So the larger the maximum value the less efficient the memory storage is. Memcached also has to pre-allocate some memory for every slab that exists, so setting a smaller factorial with a larger max value will require even more overhead. There're other reason why you wouldn't want to do that... If we're talking about a web page and you're attempting to store/load values that large, you're probably doing something wrong. At that size it'll take a noticeable amount of time to load and unpack the data structure into memory, and your site will likely not perform very well. If you really do want to store items larger than 1MB, you can recompile memcached with an edited slabs.c:POWER_BLOCK value, or use the inefficient malloc/free backend. Other suggestions include a database, MogileFS, etc. "}

For readability, I personally prefer Mike Stone's proposal above. It's easy to verbosely comment and preserves all of the computational advantages of being able to early out. You can also do the same technique inline in a function if it'd confuse the organization of your code to move the conditional evaluation far away from your other function.

For new installs, we have a metadata.sql file in the repository which holds all the DB schema, then in the build process we use this file to generate the database.

We keep it hardcoded because we don't like solving problems before it really IS a problem, and this kind of thing didn't prove to be a problem so far. So in our software we have something like this: RegisterUpgrade(1, 'ALTER TABLE XX ADD XY CHAR(1) NOT NULL;'); This code will check if the database is in version 1 (which is stored in a table created automatically), if it is outdated, then the command is executed. To update the metadata.sql in the repository, we run this upgrades locally and then extract the full database metadata. The only thing that happens every so often, is to forget commiting the metadata.sql, but this isn't a major problem because its easy to test on the build process and also the only thing that could happen is to make a new install with an outdated database and upgraded it on the first use.

The convention is to include the parameter name which was null in the message of the exception. The pattern goes: public void someMethod(Object mustNotBeNull) { if (mustNotBeNull == null) { throw new NullPointerException(\"mustNotBeNull must not be null\"); } } Whatever you do, don't allow a bad value to get set and throw an exception later when other code attempts to use it.

Here's our setup. Each developer has a virtual machine running our app and the MySQL database. It is their personal sandbox to do whatever they want. Currently, developers will make a change to the SQL schema and do a dump of the database to a text file that they commit into SVN. We're wanting to deploy a continuous integration development server that will always be running the latest committed code. If we do that now, it will reload the database from SVN for each build. We have a test (virtual) server that runs \"release candidates.\" Deploying to the test server is currently a very manual process, and usually involves me loading the latest SQL from SVN and tweaking it. Also, the data on the test server is inconsistent. You end up with whatever test data the last developer to commit had on his sandbox server. Where everything breaks down is the deployment to production. Since we can't overwrite the live data with test data, this involves manually re-creating all the schema changes. If there were a large number of schema changes or conversion scripts to manipulate the data, this can get really hairy. If the problem was just the schema, It'd be an easier problem, but there is \"base\" data in the database that is updated during development as well, such as meta-data in security and permissions tables. This is the biggest barrier I see in moving toward continuous integration and one-step-builds. How do you solve it? A follow-up question: how do you track database versions so you know which scripts to run to upgrade a given database instance? Is a version table like Lance mentions below the standard procedure? Thanks for the reference to Tarantino. I'm not in a .NET environment, but I found their DataBaseChangeMangement wiki page to be very helpful. Especially this Powerpoint Presentation (.ppt) I'm going to write a Python script that checks the names of *.sql scripts in a given directory against a table in the database and runs the ones that aren't there in order based on a integer that forms the first part of the filename. If it is a pretty simple solution, as I suspect it will be, then I'll post it here. I've got a working script for this. It handles initializing the DB if it doesn't exist and running upgrade scripts as necessary. There are also switches for wiping an existing database and importing test data from a file. It's about 200 lines, so I won't post it (though I might put it on pastebin if there's interest). "}

Unfortunately, the time is coming up an hour off. I looked into it and discovered that my default TimeZone is being set to: sun.util.calendar.ZoneInfo[id=\"GMT-08:00\", offset=-28800000, dstSavings=0, useDaylight=false, transitions=0, lastRule=null] Rather than the Pacific time zone. This is further indicated when I try to print the default time zone's display name, and it comes up \"GMT-08:00\", which seems to indicate to me that it is not correctly set to the US Pacific time zone. I am running on Ubuntu Hardy Heron, upgraded from Gutsy Gibbon. Is there a configuration file I can update to tell the JRE to use Pacific with all the associated daylight savings time information? The time on my machine shows correctly, so it doesn't seem to be an OS-wide misconfiguration. Ok, here's an update. A coworker suggested I update JAVA_OPTS in my /etc/profile to include \"-Duser.timezone=US/Pacific\", which worked (I also saw CATALINA_OPTS, which I updated as well). Actually, I just exported the change into the variables rather than use the new /etc/profile (a reboot later will pick up the changes and I will be golden). However, I still think there is a better solution... there should be a configuration for Java somewhere that says what timezone it is using, or how it is grabbing the timezone. If someone knows such a setting, that would be awesome, but for now this is a decent workaround. I am using 1.5, and it is most definitely a DST problem. As you can see, the time zone is set to not use daylight savings. My belief is it is generically set to -8 offset rather than the specific Pacific timezone. Since the generic -8 offset has no daylight savings info, it's of course not using it, but the question is, where do I tell Java to use Pacific time zone when it starts up? I'm NOT looking for a programmatic solution, it should be a configuration solution. "}

This is my first stackoverflow answer. :) As has been pointed out, when realloc() is called, you can potentially change the pointer to the memory being reallocated. When this happens, the argument \"string\" becomes invalid. Even if you reassign it, the change goes out of scope once the function ends. To answer the OP, realloc() returns a pointer to the newly-reallocated memory. The return value needs to be stored somewhere. Generally, you would do this: data *foo = malloc(SIZE * sizeof(data)); data *bar = realloc(foo, NEWSIZE * sizeof(data)); /* Test bar for safety before blowing away foo */ if (bar != NULL) { foo = bar; bar = NULL; } else { fprintf(stderr, \"Crap. Memory error.\\n\"); free(foo); exit(-1); } As TyBoer points out, you guys can't change the value of the pointer being passed in as the input to this function. You can assign whatever you want, but the change will go out of scope at the end of the function. In the following block, \"input\" may or may not be an invalid pointer once the function completes: void foobar(char *input, int newlength) { /* Here, I ignore my own advice to save space. Check your return values! */ input = realloc(input, newlength * sizeof(char)); } Mark tries to work around this by returning the new pointer as the output of the function. If you do that, the onus is on the caller to never again use the pointer he used for input. If it matches the return value, then you have two pointers to the same spot and only need to call free() on one of them. If they don't match, the input pointer now points to memory that may or may not be owned by the process. Dereferencing it could cause a segmentation fault. You could use a double pointer for the input, like this: void foobar(char **input, int newlength) { *input = realloc(*input, newlength * sizeof(char)); } If the caller has a duplicate of the input pointer somewhere, that duplicate still might be invalid now. I think the cleanest solution here is to avoid using realloc() when trying to modify the function caller's input. Just malloc() a new buffer, return that, and let the caller decide whether or not to free the old text. This has the added benefit of letting the caller keep the original string! "}

No matter what, you're probably going to have to do some of this by hand, but you may be able to automate the bulk of it. For the example locations you gave, a query like the following would set the appropriate company_id value: UPDATE Location SET Company_ID = 1 WHERE (LOWER(Location_Name) LIKE '%to_n shop%' OR LOWER(Location_Name) LIKE '%tts%') AND Company_ID IS NULL; I believe that would match your examples (I added the IS NULL part to not overwrite previously set Company_ID values), but of course in 18,000 rows you're going to have to be pretty inventive to handle the various combinations. Something else that might help would be to use the names in Company to generate queries like the one above. You could do something like the following (in MySQL): SELECT CONCAT('UPDATE Location SET Company_ID = ', Company_ID, ' WHERE LOWER(Location_Name) LIKE ', LOWER(REPLACE(Company_Name), ' ', '%'), ' AND Company_ID IS NULL;') FROM Company; Then just run the statements that it produces.

But as regards the wider point you definitely seem to have the right of it according to this rather fine article I found: JavaScript \u201cAssociative Arrays\u201d Considered Harmful But according to all this, isn't the accepted answer itself bad practice? Specify a prototype size() function for Object If anything else has been added to Object .prototype, then the suggested code will fail: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> Object.prototype.size = function () { var len = this.length ? --this.length : -1; for (var k in this) len++; return len; } Object.prototype.size2 = function () { var len = this.length ? --this.length : -1; for (var k in this) len++; return len; } var myArray = new Object(); myArray[\"firstname\"] = \"Gareth\"; myArray[\"lastname\"] = \"Simpson\"; myArray[\"age\"] = 21; alert(\"age is \" + myArray[\"age\"]); alert(\"length is \" + myArray.size()); </script> I don't think that answer should be the accepted one as it can't be trusted to work if you have any other code running in the same execution context.

I use continue when doing something with most elements of a list, but still want to skip over a few. The break statement also comes in handy when polling for a valid response from somebody or something. Instead of: Ask a question While the answer is invalid: Ask the question You could eliminate some duplication and use: While True: Ask a question If the answer is valid: break The do-until loop that I mentioned before is the more elegant solution for that particular problem: Do: Ask a question Until the answer is valid No duplication, and no break needed either.

Oh yes, absolutely. So for example, we use a single layer of subfolders, generally: require_once('library/string.class.php') You need to be careful with relying on the include path too much in really high traffic sites, because php has to hunt through the current directory and then all the directories on the include path in order to see if your file is there and this can slow things up if you're getting hammered. So for example if you're doing MVC, you'd put the path to your application directoy in the include path and then specify refer to things in the form 'model/user.class' 'controllers/front.php' or whatever. But generally speaking, it just lets you work with really short paths in your PHP that will work from anywhere and it's a lot easier to read than all that realpath document root malarkey. The benefit of those script-based alternatives others have suggested is they work anywhere, even on shared boxes; setting the include path requires a little more thought and effort but as I mentioned lets you start using __autoload which just the coolest.

This implies that by using the second method, you are not cluttering up the global variables scope which is good as these global variable values can interfere with some other global variables that you may use in some other library or are being used in a third party library.

{"user":"488","questionId":"4582","creationDate":"2008-08-09T01:03:18.317","answerId":"6503","type":"answer","body":"The result of a DCT is a transformation of the original source into the frequency domain. The top left entry stores the \"amplitude\" the \"base\" frequency and frequency increases both along the horizontal and vertical axes. The outcome of the DCT is usually a collection of amplitudes at the more usual lower frequencies (the top left quadrant) and less entries at the higher frequencies. As lassevk mentioned, it is usual to just zero out these higher frequencies as they typically constitute very minor parts of the source. However, this does result in loss of information. To complete the compression it is usual to use a lossless compression over the DCT'd source. This is where the compression comes in as all those runs of zeros get packed down to almost nothing. One possible advantage of using the DCT to find similar regions is that you can do a first pass match on low frequency values (top-left corner). This reduces the number of values you need to match against. If you find matches of low frequency values, you can increase into comparing the higher frequencies. Hope this helps "}

Avoid code that doesn't do what it looks like it's doing! Also the (function(){ ... })(); make nice bookend tokens so that you can immediately see that you're entering and leaving a closure scope.

What language I use has always been an implementation detail and not part of the design. Having to solve the problem by breaking it down into it's basic steps is a key skill. I think it is one of the things that separates those that can program from those that can't. As far as how you tackle the order of concepts of a language I believe the easiest way is to decide that is to have a project in mind and tackle the concepts as they are needed. This lets you apply them as they are needed on something that you are interested in doing.

PS: My memory is a bit hazy on this so apologies if I'm wrong instead of break/continue, it has break/next, which behave the same in terms of loops Loops (like everything else) are expressions, and \"return\" the last thing that they did. Most of the time, getting the return value from a loop is pointless, so everyone just does this a = 5 while a < 10 a + 1 end You can however do this a = 5 b = while a < 10 a + 1 end # b is now 10 HOWEVER, a lot of ruby code 'emulates' a loop by using a block. The canonical example is 10.times do |x| puts x end As it is much more common for people to want to do things with the result of a block, this is where it gets messy. break/next mean different things in the context of a block. break will jump out of the code that called the block next will skip the rest of the code in the block, and 'return' what you specify to the caller of the block. This doesn't make any sense without examples. def timesten 10.times{ |t| puts yield t } end timesten do |x| x * 2 end # will print 2 4 6 8 ... and so on timesten do |x| break x * 2 end # won't print anything. The break jumps out of the timesten function entirely, and the call to `puts` inside it gets skipped timesten do |x| break 5 x * 2 end # This is the same as above. it's \"returning\" 5, but nobody is catching it. If you did a = timesten... then a would get assigned to 5 timesten do |x| next 5 x * 2 end # this would print 5 5 5 ... and so on, because 'next 5' skips the 'x * 2' and 'returns' 5. So yeah.

That said, first it would depend on if I can tell if they are broken or not from the floor I am dropping them at. I will presume I can. I would go up to the second floor, drop the first marble. If it broke I would try the first floor. If that broke I would know it was no floor. If the first didn't break, I would go to the 4th floor and drop from there. If that broke, I would go back down and get the other marble, then drop at the 3rd floor, breaking or not I would know which is the limit. If neither broke, I would go get both, and do the same process, this time starting at the 6th floor. This way, I can skip every other floor until I get a marble that breaks. This would be optimized for if the marble breaks early... I suppose there is probably an optimal amount of floors I could skip to get the most for each skip... but then if one breaks, I would have to check each floor individually from the first floor above the last known floor... which of course would be a pain if I skipped too many floors (sorry, not going to figure out the optimal solution right now).

The old hands very quickly slack off, and just say things like 'I'm still working on X', which they've been doing for the past week - It takes a strong leader to force them to delve into details. Refactoring is now a really misused term, but when you've got sufficient unit tests, it's really useful to conceptually separate the activity of 'changing the design of the existing code without changing the functionality' from 'adding new functionality' "}
{"user":"457","questionId":"6578","creationDate":"2008-08-09T03:48:10.417","answerId":"6592","type":"answer","body":"Objective-C uses Reference Counting, which means each Object has a reference count. When an object is created, it has a reference count of \"1\". Simply speaking, when an object is referred to (ie, stored somewhere), it gets \"retained\" which means its reference count is increased by one. When an object is no longer needed, it is \"released\" which means its reference count is decreased by one. When an object's reference count is 0, the object is freed. This is basic reference counting. For some languages, references are automatically increased and decreased, but objective-c is not one of those languages. Thus the programmer is responsible for retaining and releasing. A typical way to write a method is: id myVar = [someObject someMessage]; .... do something ....; [myVar release]; return someValue; The problem of needing to remember to release any acquired resources inside of code is both tedious and error-prone. Objective-C introduces another concept aimed at making this much easier: Autorelease Pools. Autorelease pools are special objects that are installed on each thread. They are a fairly simple class, if you look up NSAutoreleasePool. When an object gets an \"autorelease\" message sent to it, the object will look for any autorelease pools sitting on the stack for this current thread. It will add the object to the list as an object to send a \"release\" message to at some point in the future, which is generally when the pool itself is released. Taking the code above, you can rewrite it to be shorter and easier to read by saying: id myVar = [[someObject someMessage] autorelease]; ... do something ...; return someValue; Because the object is autoreleased, we no longer need to explicitly call \"release\" on it. This is because we know some autorelease pool will do it for us later. Hopefully this helps. The Wikipedia article is pretty good about reference counting. More information about autorelease pools can be found here. Also note that if you are building for Mac OS X 10.5 and later, you can tell Xcode to build with garbage collection enabled, allowing you to completely ignore retain/release/autorelease. "}

Here's some supplemental info pertaining to manual memory management (required on the iPhone). If you personally alloc/init an object, it comes with a reference count of 1. You are responsible for cleaning up after it when it's no longer needed, either by calling [foo release] or [foo autorelease]. release cleans it up right away, whereas autorelease adds the object to the autorelease pool, which will automatically release it at a later time. autorelease is primarily for when you have a method that needs to return the object in question (so you can't manually release it, else you'll be returning a nil object) but you don't want to hold on to it, either. If you acquire an object where you did not call alloc/init to get it -- for example: foo = [NSString stringWithString:@\"hello\"]; but you want to hang on to this object, you need to call [foo retain]. Otherwise, it's possible it will get autoreleased and you'll be holding on to a nil reference (as it would in the above stringWithString example). When you no longer need it, call [foo release]. "}

{"user":"863","questionId":"6578","creationDate":"2008-08-09T04:40:49.250","answerId":"6614","type":"answer","body":"Let's start with retain and release; autorelease is really just a special case once you understand the basic concepts. In Cocoa, each object keeps track of how many times it is being referenced (specifically, the NSObject base class implements this). By calling retain on an object, you are telling it that you want to up its reference count by one. By calling release, you tell the object you are letting go of it, and its reference count is decremented. If, after calling release, the reference count is now zero, then that object's memory is freed by the system. The basic way this differs from malloc and free is that any given object doesn't need to worry about other parts of the system crashing because you've freed memory they were using. Assuming everyone is playing along and retaining/releasing according to the rules, when one piece of code retains and then releases the object, any other piece of code also referencing the object will be unaffected. What can sometimes be confusing is knowing the circumstances under which you should call retain and release. My general rule of thumb is that if I want to hang on to an object for some length of time (if it's a member variable in a class, for instance), then I need to make sure the object's reference count knows about me. As described above, an object's reference count is incremented by calling retain. By convention, it is also incremented (set to 1, really) when the object is created with an \"init\" method. In either of these cases, it is my responsibility to call release on the object when I'm done with it. If I don't, there will be a memory leak. Example of object creation: NSString* s = [[NSString alloc] init]; // Ref count is 1 [s retain]; // Ref count is 2 - silly // to do this after init [s release]; // Ref count is back to 1 [s release]; // Ref count is 0, object is freed Now for autorelease. Autorelease is used as a convenient (and sometimes necessary) way to tell the system to free this object up after a little while. From a plumbing perspective, when autorelease is called, the current thread's NSAutoreleasePool is alerted of the call. The NSAutoreleasePool now knows that once it gets an opportunity (after the current iteration of the event loop), it can call release on the object. From our perspective as programmers, it takes care of calling release for us, so we don't have to (and in fact, we shouldn't). What's important to note is that (again, by convention) all object creation class methods return an autoreleased object. For example, in the following example, the variable \"s\" has a reference count of 1, but after the event loop completes, it will be destroyed. NSString* s = [NSString stringWithString:@\"Hello World\"]; If you want to hang onto that string, you'd need to call retain explicitly, and then explicitly release it when you're done. Consider the following (very contrived) bit of code, and you'll see a situation where autorelease is required: - (NSString*)createHelloWorldString { NSString* s = [[NSString alloc] initWithString:@\"Hello World\"]; // Now what? We want to return s, but we've upped its reference count. // The caller shouldn't be responsible for releasing it, since we're the // ones that created it. If we call release, however, the reference // count will hit zero and bad memory will be returned to the caller. // The answer is to call autorelease before returning the string. By // explicitly calling autorelease, we pass the responsibility for // releasing the string on to the thread's NSAutoreleasePool, which will // happen at some later time. The consequence is that the returned string // will still be valid for the caller of this function. return [s autorelease]; } I realize all of this is a bit confusing - at some point, though, it will click. Here are a few references to get you going: Apple's introduction to memory management. Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X (4th Edition), by Aaron Hillegas - a very well written book with lots of great examples. It reads like a tutorial. If you're truly diving in, you could head to Big Nerd Ranch. This is a training facility run by Aaron Hillegas - the author of the book mentioned above.

Second, depending on the relative location of the file, this technique might create an external dependency and limit the application\u2019s mobility. If the file exists outside the application\u2019s current directory, this creates an external dependency and one would have to be aware of the dependency in order to move the application to another machine (error prone).

All array indices are of type 'int' first, then type 'string', and will be cast to that as PHP sees fit. Performance wise, $index should be faster than \"$index\" and \"{$index}\" (which are the same). Once you start a double-quote string, PHP will go into interpolation mode and treat it as a string first, but looking for variable markers ($, {}, etc) to replace from the local scope. This is why in most discussions, true 'static' strings should always be single quotes unless you need the escape-shortcuts like \"\\n\" or \"\\t\", because PHP will not need to try to interpolate the string at runtime and the full string can be compiled statically. In this case, doublequoting will first copy the $index into that string, then return the string, where directly using $index will just return the string. "}

Regardless of the decision, it is pretty trivial to run both. TestNG strives to be much more configurable than JUnit, but in the end they both work equally well. TestNG has a neat feature where you can mark tests as a particular group, and then easily run all tests of a specific group, or exclude tests of a particular group. Thus you can mark tests that run slowly as in the \"slow\" group and then ignore them when you want quick results. A suggestion from their documentation is to mark some subset as \"checkin\" tests which should be run whenever you check new files in. I never saw such a feature in JUnit, but then again, if you don't have it, you don't REALLY miss it. For all its claims of high configuration, I did run into a corner case the a couple weeks ago where I couldn't do what I wanted to do...

A problem is better solved with OOP when you are better at solving problems and thinking in an OO mentality. Object Orientation is just another tool which has come along through trying to make computing a better tool for solving problems. However, it can allow for better code reuse, and can also lead to neater code. But quite often these highly praised qualities are, in-relity, of little real value. Applying OO techniques to an existing functional application could really cause a lot of problems. The skill lies in learning many different techniques and applying the most appropriate to the problem at hand. OO is often quoted as a Nirvana like solution to the software development, where many times it is not appropriate to be applied to the issue at hand. It can, quite often, lead to overengineering of a problem to reach the perfect solution, when often it is really not necessary. In essence, OOP is not really Object Oriented Programming, but mapping Object Oriented Thinking to a programming language capable of supporting OO Techniques. OO Techniques can be supported by languages which are not inherently OO, and there are techniques you can use within functional languages to take advantage of benefits. As an example, I have been developing OO software for about 20 years now, so I tend to think in OO terms when solving problems, irrespective of the language I am writing in. Currently I am implementing polymorphism using Perl 5.6, which does not natively support it. I have chosen to do this as it will make maintenance and extension of the code a simple configuration task, rather than a development issue. Not sure if this is clear. There aare people who are hard in the OO court, and there are people who are hard in the Functional court. And then there are people who have tried both and try to take the best from each. Neither is perfect, but both have some very good traits that you can utilise no matter what the language. If you are trying to learn OOP, don't just concentrate on OOP, but try to utilise Object Oriented Analysis and general OO principles to the whole spectrum of the problem solution. "}

A String concatenation operation always allocates memory, whereas a StringBuilder concatenation operation only allocates memory if the StringBuilder object buffer is too small to accommodate the new data. Consequently, the String class is preferable for a concatenation operation if a fixed number of String objects are concatenated. In that case, the individual concatenation operations might even be combined into a single operation by the compiler. A StringBuilder object is preferable for a concatenation operation if an arbitrary number of strings are concatenated; for example, if a loop concatenates a random number of strings of user input. "}

Unless you're crushing together tons of strings, or building something for a lower powered mobile device, this probably won't make much of a dent in your run speed. I've found that, in cases where I'm building strings in a fairly linear fashion, either doing straight concatenations or using StringBuilder is your best option. I suggest this in cases where the majority of the string that you're building is dynamic. Since very little of the text is static, the most important thing is that it's clear where each piece of dynamic text is being put in case it needs updated in the future. On the other hand, if you're talking about a big chunk of static text with two or three variables in it, even if it's a little less efficient, I think the clarity you gain from string.Format makes it worth it. I used this earlier this week when having to place one bit of dynamic text in the center of a 4 page document. It'll be easier to update that big chunk of text if its in one piece than having to update three pieces that you concatenate together. "}

However, in other circumstances, having a hierarchy of exceptions is very convenient for the user of your classes. Suppose you're implementing the Facade pattern neither of the so far considered scenarios is good: is not good that you raise every exception as an Exception object because you're losing (probably) valuable information is not good neither to raise every kind of object that you catch because doing so you're failing in creating the facade In this hypothetical case, the better thing to do is to create a hierarchy of exception classes that, abstracting your users from the inner complexities of the system, allows them to know something about the kind of exception produced. As a side note: I personally dislike the use of exceptions (hierarchies of classes derived from the Exception class) to implement logic.

The best I've come up with so far is to pull all of the interesting logic for the child form into a Class Module, and have each parent form lay out the UI (in a Picture control, perhaps) and pass that Picture object into the class module.

(I don't know my C++ well enough, but is it the case that integral and constant static variables are initialized before any code is executed (ie, even before static constructors are executed - their values may already be \"initialized\" in the program image)?

Excellent, it seems that I have a couple of good answers now (shame I can't mark 2 or 3 as being the answer).

I will agree with you on the rest though, the second approach is a very bad idea because of the loss of stack trace. When I worked with .NET, I ran into many cases where other programmers did just that, and it frustrated me to no end when I needed to see the true cause of an exception, only to find it being rethrown from a huge try block where I now have no idea where the problem originated. I also second Brad's comment that you shouldn't worry about the performance. This kind of micro optimization is a HORRIBLE idea. Unless you are talking about throwing an exception in every iteration of a for loop that is running for a long time, you will more than likely not run into performance issues by the way of your exception usage. Always optimize performance when you have metrics that indicate you NEED to optimize performance, and then hit the spots that are proven to be the culprit. It is much better to have readable code with easy debugging capabilities (IE not hiding the stack trace) rather than make something run a nanosecond faster. A final note about wrapping exceptions into a custom exception... this can be a very useful construct, especially when dealing with UIs. You can wrap every known and reasonable exceptional case into some base custom exception (or one that extends from said base exception), and then the UI can just catch this base exception. When caught, the exception will need to provide means of displaying information to the user, say a ReadableMessage property, or something along those lines. Thus, any time the UI misses an exception, it is because of a bug you need to fix, and anytime it catches an exception, it is a known error condition that can and should be handled properly by the UI.

If you receive an object in any other way, you are not the owner of it and should not ensure it is sent -release. If you want to make sure an object is sent -release you can either send that yourself, or you can send the object -autorelease and the current autorelease pool will send it -release (once per received -autorelease) when the pool is drained. Typically -autorelease is used as a way of ensuring that objects live for the length of the current event, but are cleaned up afterwards, as there is an autorelease pool that surrounds Cocoa's event processing.

{"user":"714","questionId":"6915","creationDate":"2008-08-09T23:09:01.400","answerId":"6943","type":"answer","body":"Unfortunately, Matt's answer features what's called double-checked locking which isn't supported by the C/C++ memory model. (It is supported by the Java 1.5 and later \u2014 and I think .NET \u2014 memory model.) This means that between the time when the pObj == NULL check takes place and when the lock (mutex) is acquired, pObj may have already been assigned on another thread. Thread switching happens whenever the OS wants it to, not between \"lines\" of a program (which have no meaning post-compilation in most languages). Furthermore, as Matt acknowledges, he uses an int as a lock rather than an OS primitive. Don't do that. Proper locks require the use of memory barrier instructions, potentially cache-line flushes, and so on; use your operating system's primitives for locking. This is especially important because the primitives used can change between the individual CPU lines that your operating system runs on; what works on a CPU Foo might not work on CPU Foo2. Most operating systems either natively support POSIX threads (pthreads) or offer them as a wrapper for the OS threading package, so it's often best to illustrate examples using them. If your operating system offers appropriate primitives, and if you absolutely need it for performance, instead of doing this type of locking/initialization you can use an atomic compare and swap operation to initialize a shared global variable. Essentially, what you write will look like this: MySingleton *MySingleton::GetSingleton() { if (pObj == NULL) { // create a temporary instance of the singleton MySingleton *temp = new MySingleton(); if (OSAtomicCompareAndSwapPtrBarrier(NULL, temp, &pObj) == false) { // if the swap didn't take place, delete the temporary instance delete temp; } } return pObj; } This only works if it's safe to create multiple instances of your singleton (one per thread that happens to invoke GetSingleton() simultaneously), and then throw extras away. The OSAtomicCompareAndSwapPtrBarrier function provided on Mac OS X \u2014 most operating systems provide a similar primitive \u2014 checks whether pObj is NULL and only actually sets it to temp to it if it is. This uses hardware support to really, literally only perform the swap once and tell whether it happened. Another facility to leverage if your OS offers it that's in between these two extremes is pthread_once. This lets you set up a function that's run only once - basically by doing all of the locking/barrier/etc. trickery for you - no matter how many times it's invoked or on how many threads it's invoked.

One of the most mature ones is erlang (and this excellent and fun book: http://www.pragprog.com/titles/jaerlang/programming-erlang). May not be exactly relevant to your circumstances, but you can still learn a lot of ideas that you may be able to apply in other tools. For other environments: .Net has F# (to learn functional programming). JVM has Scala (which has actors, very much like Erlang, and is functional hybrid language).

Middle Monitor: code / debugging Right Monitor: Test application / scrolling logfiles (if needed) This usually works pretty well, and since the monitors are fairly big I rarely need to use the test application in full-screen, so there's plenty of room for my tail -f windows. I also use AutoHotkey to assign hotkeys that flip to the most important windows, like Firefox or my SSH session. That way I can simply use a shortcut key to access them when necessary. The left monitor is actually a separate computer running Linux and keyboard/mouse shared with Synergy, so I have multiple ebooks or documentation pages open, one on each virtual desktop...

{"user":"872","questionId":"6915","creationDate":"2008-08-09T23:52:40.253","answerId":"6955","type":"answer","body":"Basically, you're asking for synchronized creation of a singleton, without using any synchronization (previously-constructed variables). In general, no, this is not possible. You need something available for synchronization. As for your other question, yes, static variables which can be statically initialized (i.e. no runtime code necessary) are guaranteed to be initialized before other code is executed. This makes it possible to use a statically-initialized mutex to synchronize creation of the singleton. From the 2003 revision of the C++ standard: Objects with static storage duration (3.7.1) shall be zero-initialized (8.5) before any other initialization takes place. Zero-initialization and initialization with a constant expression are collectively called static initialization; all other initialization is dynamic initialization. Objects of POD types (3.9) with static storage duration initialized with constant expressions (5.19) shall be initialized before any dynamic initialization takes place. Objects with static storage duration defined in namespace scope in the same translation unit and dynamically initialized shall be initialized in the order in which their definition appears in the translation unit. If you know that you will be using this singleton during the initialization of other static objects, I think you'll find that synchronization is a non-issue. To the best of my knowledge, all major compilers initialize static objects in a single thread, so thread-safety during static initialization. You can declare your singleton pointer to be NULL, and then check to see if it's been initialized before you use it. However, this assumes that you know that you'll use this singleton during static initialization. This is also not guaranteed by the standard, so if you want to be completely safe, use a statically-initialized mutex. Edit: Chris's suggestion to use an atomic compare-and-swap would certainly work. If portability is not an issue (and creating additional temporary singletons is not a problem), then it is a slightly lower overhead solution. "}

The middle one is least correct because it looses the stack. I personally use custom exceptions if I want to decouple certain dependencies in code. For example, I have a method that loads data from an XML file. This can go wrong in many different ways. It could fail to read from the disk (FileIOException), the user could try to access it from somewhere where they are not allowed (SecurityException), the file could be corrupt (XmlParseException), data could be in the wrong format (DeserialisationException). In this case, so its easier for the calling class to make sense of all this, all these exceptions rethrow a single custom exception (FileOperationException) so that means the caller does not need references to System.IO or System.Xml, but can still access what error occurred through an enum and any important information. As stated, don't try to micro-optimize something like this, the act of throwing an exception at all is the slowest thing that occurs here. The best improvement to make is to try avoiding an exception at all. public bool Load(string filepath) { if (File.Exists(filepath)) //Avoid throwing by checking state { //Wrap anyways in case something changes between check and operation try { .... } catch (IOException ioFault) { .... } catch (OtherException otherFault) { .... } return true; //Inform caller of success } else { return false; } //Inform caller of failure due to state } "}

WCF does have a learning curve beyond a [WebMethod] attribute, but the learning curve is over-exaggerated in my opinion, and it is exponentially more powerful and future proof than legacy ASMX services.

I didn't do the math, but I think during a leap year, with a hard code of 28 days for feb, a comparison of noon on 2/29 and noon on 3/1 would result in the same duplicate time stamp as before. Although it looks like you didn't implement it like that. They way you implemented it, I think you still have the problem but it's between dates on 12/31 of $leapyear and 1/1 of $leapyear+1. I think you might also have some collisions during time changes if your code has to handle time zones that handle them. The file doesn't really seem to be sorted in any useful way. I'm guessing that field $1 is some sort of status (the \"OK\" you're checking for). So it's sorted by record status, then by DAY, then MONTH, YEAR, HOURS, MINUTES, SECONDS. If it was year,month,day I think there could be some optimizations there. Still might be but my brain's going in a different direction right now. If there are a small number of duplicate keys in proportion to total number of lines, I think your best bet is to reduce the file your awk script works over to just duplicate keys (as David said). You could also preprocess the file so the only lines present are the /OK/ lines. I think I would do this with a pipeline where the first awk script only prints the lines with duplicate IDs and the second awk script is basically the one above but optimized to not look for /OK/ and with the knowledge that any key present is a duplicate key. If you know ahead of time that all or most lines will have repeated keys, it's probably not worth messing with. I'd bite the bullet and write it in C. Tons more lines of code, much faster than the awk script. "}

I'd recommend getting familiar with the former before diving into the latter. Before writing any shaders, it's a good idea to get solid understanding of the shader pipeline, and attempt to get your mind around what is possible when using programmable shaders. When you're familiar with the life of a pixel (from source data all the way through to the screen) then understanding examples of shaders becomes a lot easier. Next make an attempt to write your own HLSL which does what the Fixed T&L pipeline used to do, just to get you hands dirty. This is the equivalent of a \"hello world\" program in vertex/pixel shader world. When you're able to do that and you understand what you've written you're ready to go onto the more fun stuff. As a next step you might want to simulate basic sepcular lighting in one of your shaders from a single light source. You can then adapt this down the track to use multiple lights. Play with colours, and movement of lights. This will help get familiar with the use of shader constants as well. When you have a couple of basic shaders together, you should attempt to make it so that your game/engine uses multiple/different shaders on different objects. Start adding some other bits like basic bump or normal maps. When you get to this stage, the world is your oyster. You can start diving into some funky effectcs, and even consider using the GPU for more than it was originally intended. For those who are a little more advanced, there are a couple of good books that are available for free online which have some great information from Nvidia here and here. Don't forget that there's an excellent series of books called ShaderX which covers some awesome shader stuff. There's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 already in print, and 7 is coming soon. Good luck. If you get some shaders going, I'd love to see them :) "}

The only reason to add a special thread to handle reading is if you expect some lines to take a very long time to process and you expect that these lines are clustered in a single part of the file.

They have all used typedefs (or #defines) for types such as UINT32. This is a good technique as it drives home the size of the type to the programmer and makes you more conscious of chances for overflow etc. But on some systems you know that the compiler and processor won't change for the life of the project. So what should influence your decision to create and enforce project-specific types? EDIT I think I managed to lose the gist of my question, and maybe it's really two. With embedded programming you may need types of specific size for interfaces and also to cope with restricted resources such as RAM. This can't be avoided, but you can choose to use the basic types from the compiler. For everything else the types have less importance. You need to be careful not to cause overflow and may need to watch out for register and stack usage. Which may lead you to UINT16, UCHAR. Using types such as UCHAR can add compiler 'fluff' however. Because registers are typically larger, some compilers may add code to force the result into the type. i++; can become ADD REG,1 AND REG, 0xFF which is unecessary. So I think my question should have been :- given the constraints of embedded software what is the best policy to set for a project which will have many people working on it - not all of whom will be of the same level of experience.

After you work through this book you'll be ready to tackle research papers directly for more depth if you need it. I must confess I have a serious soft spot for Niklaus Wirth's Compiler Construction. It is available online as a PDF. I find Wirth's programming aesthetic simply beautiful, however some people find his style too minimal (for example Wirth favors recursive descent parsers, but most CS courses focus on parser generator tools; Wirth's language designs are fairly conservative.)

For setters, make sure to clone any mutable objects, and store the clone. This way, callers cannot change the passed-in object after the fact to break your program's invariants. For getters, either return an immutable view of your internal data, if the interface allows it; or else return a clone of the internal data. When calling user-supplied callbacks with internal data, send in an immutable view or clone, as appropriate, unless you intend the callback to alter the data, in which case you have to validate it after the fact.

If you just need all of the work started in the loop to finish before the code continues, but you don't care about the order the work within the loop finishes, then calling Join is the answer. To add more detail to Kevin Kenny's answer, you should call Join outside the loop. This means you will need a collection to hold references to the threads you started: // Start all of the threads.

So unless you have some whacky IL on the loose calling Singleton::.cctor directly (unlikely) your static constructor will run exactly once before the Singleton type is used, only one instance of Singleton will be created, and your Instance property is thread-safe. Note that if Singleton's constructor accesses the Instance property (even indirectly) then the Instance property will be null. The best you can do is detect when this happens and throw an exception, by checking that instance is non-null in the property accessor. After your static constructor completes the Instance property will be non-null. As Zoomba's answer points out you will need to make Singleton safe to access from multiple threads, or implement a locking mechanism around using the singleton instance. "}

If you can use a compiler that supports C99 (gcc does), you'll find these in <stdint.h> and you can just use them in your projects. Also, it can be especially important in embedded projects to use types as a sort of \"safety net\" for things like unit conversions. If you can use C++, I understand that there are some \"unit\" libraries out there that let you work in physical units that are defined by the C++ type system (via templates) that are compiled as operations on the underlying scalar types. For example, these libraries won't let you add a distance_t to a mass_t because the units don't line up; you'll actually get a compiler error. Even if you can't work in C++ or another language that lets you write code that way, you can at least use the C type system to help you catch errors like that by eye. (That was actually the original intent of Simonyi's Hungarian notation.) Just because the compiler won't yell at you for adding a meter_t to a gram_t doesn't mean you shouldn't use types like that. Code reviews will be much more productive at discovering unit errors then. "}

Things like avoiding deprecated functions, which (in the Microsoft C++ libraries at least) are commonly deprecated because of security vulnerabilities, and validating everything that crosses an external boundary. Functions that are only called from your code should not require excessive parameter validation because you control the caller, that is, no external boundary is crossed. Functions called by other people's code should assume that the incoming parameters will be invalid and/or malicious at some point. My approach to dealing with exposed functions is to simply crash out, with a helpful message if possible. If the caller can't get the parameters right then the problem is in their code and they should fix it, not you. (Obviously you have provided documentation for your function, since it is exposed.) Code injection is only an issue if your application is able to elevate the current user. If a process can inject code into your application then it could easily write the code to memory and execute it anyway. Without being able to gain full access to the system code injection attacks are pointless. (This is why applications used by administrators should not be writeable by lesser users.) "}

Using .NET's CodeDom we compile the scripts from the database, using the VB CodeDomProvider (annoyingly it defaults to .NET 2, if you want to support 3.5 features you need to pass a dictionary with \"CompilerVersion\" = \"v3.5\" to its constructor).

You basically have a few options: object o; //checking with is o is int //check type o.GetType() != typeof( int ) //cast and catch exception try{ int j = (int) o; } catch {} //use the tryparse int.TryParse( Convert.ToString( o ), out j ) You can easily set up a console app that tries each of these 10,000 times and returns durations for each (test when o is an int and when it's something else). The try-catch method is the quickest if the object does hold an int, and by far the slowest if it doesn't (even slower than GetType). int.TryParse is pretty quick if you have a string, but if you have an unknown object it's slower. Interestingly, with .Net 3.5 and optimisations turned on the o is int check takes the same time as try-catch when o actually is an int. o is int is only slightly slower if o actually is something else. Annoyingly FxCop will throw up warnings if you do something like: if( o is int ) int j = (int) o; But I think that's a bug in FxCop - it doesn't know int is a value type and recommends you to use o as int instead. If your input is always a string int.TryParse is best, otherwise the is operator is quickest. As you have a string I'd look at whether you need to know that it's an int, rather than a double. If int.TryParse passes then so will double.TryParse so you could half the number of checks - return either double or string and floor the doubles when you expect an int. "}

Having students point to each other and using pieces of paper with house addresses are both great learning tools. They do a great job of introducing the basic concepts. Indeed, learning the basic concepts is vital to successfully using pointers. However, in production code, it's common to get into much more complex scenarios than these simple demonstrations can encapsulate. I've been involved with systems where we had structures pointing to other structures pointing to other structures. Some of those structures also contained embedded structures (rather than pointers to additional structures). This is where pointers get really confusing. If you've got multiple levels of indirection, and you start ending up with code like this: widget->wazzle.fizzle = fazzle.foozle->wazzle; it can get confusing really quickly (imagine a lot more lines, and potentially more levels). Throw in arrays of pointers, and node to node pointers (trees, linked lists) and it gets worse still. I've seen some really good developers get lost once they started working on such systems, even developers who understood the basics really well. Complex structures of pointers don't necessarily indicate poor coding, either (though they can). Composition is a vital piece of good object-oriented programming, and in languages with raw pointers, it will inevitably lead to multi-layered indirection. Further, systems often need to use third-party libraries with structures which don't match each other in style or technique. In situations like that, complexity is naturally going to arise (though certainly, we should fight it as much as possible). I think the best thing colleges can do to help students learn pointers is to to use good demonstrations, combined with projects that require pointer use. One difficult project will do more for pointer understanding than a thousand demonstrations. Demonstrations can get you a shallow understanding, but to deeply grasp pointers, you have to really use them. "}

It may seem like a waste of resources, but you will find: That these guys together can produce code plenty fast and of higher quality. If your junior guy learns enough to \"get it\" with a senior guy directing him along the right path (eg. \"Ok, now before we continue, lets write at test for this function.\") It will be well worth the resources you commit to it.

Here's what I would try: Spend some time and share testing techniques, like dependency injection, looking for edge cases, and so on with your colleague. Offer to answer questions about testing. Do code reviews of tests for a while. Ask your colleague to review changes of yours that are exemplary of good testing. Look at their comments to see if they're really reading and understanding your test code. If there are books that fit particularly well with your team's testing philosophy give him or her a copy. It might help if your code review feedback or discussions reference the book so he or she has a thread to pick up and follow. I wouldn't especially emphasize the shame/guilt factor. It is worth pointing out that testing is a widely adopted, good practice and that writing and maintaining good tests is a professional courtesy so your team mates don't need to spend their weekends at work, but I wouldn't belabor those points. If you really need to \"get tough\" then institute an impartial system; nobody likes to feel like they're being singled out.

If XML is being generated automatically - if newlines or explicit \\n flags are being parsed into - then there's nothing to worry about. Your input likely doesn't have any other XML in it so it's just cleaner to not mess with XML at all. If tags are being worked with manually, it's still cleaner to just have a line break, if you ask me. The exception is if you're using DOM to get some structure out of the XML. In that case line breaks are obviously evil because they don't represent the heirarchy properly. It sounds like the heirarchy is irrelevant for your application, though, so line breaks sound sufficient. If the XML just looks bad (especially when automatically generated), Tidy can help, although it works better with HTML than with XML. "}

The part I didn't get is that in the example construction groups = [] uniquekeys = [] for k, g in groupby(data, keyfunc): groups.append(list(g)) # Store group iterator as a list uniquekeys.append(k) k is the current grouping key, and g is an iterator that you can use to iterate over the group defined by that grouping key. In other words, the groupby iterator itself returns iterators. Here's an example of that, using clearer variable names: from itertools import groupby things = [(\"animal\", \"bear\"), (\"animal\", \"duck\"), (\"plant\", \"cactus\"), (\"vehicle\", \"speed boat\"), (\"vehicle\", \"school bus\")] for key, group in groupby(things, lambda x: x[0]): for thing in group: print \"A %s is a %s.\" % (thing[1], key) print \" \" This will give you the output: A bear is a animal. A duck is a animal. A cactus is a plant. A speed boat is a vehicle. A school bus is a vehicle. In this example, things is a list of tuples where the first item in each tuple is the group the second item belongs to. The groupby() function takes two arguments: (1) the data to group and (2) the function to group it with. Here, lambda x: x[0] tells groupby() to use the first item in each tuple as the grouping key. In the above for statement, groupby returns three (key, group iterator) pairs - once for each unique key. You can use the returned iterator to iterate over each individual item in that group. Here's a slightly different example with the same data, using a list comprehension: for key, group in groupby(things, lambda x: x[0]): listOfThings = \" and \".join([thing[1] for thing in group]) print key + \"s: \" + listOfThings + \".\" This will give you the output: animals: bear and duck. plants: cactus. vehicles: speed boat and school bus.

Thus, a machine that can act as a universal Turing machine can, in principle, perform any calculation that any other programmable computer is capable of. However, this has nothing to do with the effort required to write a program for the machine, the time it may take for the machine to perform the calculation, or any abilities the machine may possess that are unrelated to computation. While truly Turing-complete machines are very likely physically impossible, as they require unlimited storage, Turing completeness is often loosely attributed to physical machines or programming languages that would be universal if they had unlimited storage. All modern computers are Turing-complete in this sense.

While most XML processors will preserve any whitespace you put in your XML, it's not guaranteed. The real problem is that most applications that output your XML into a readable format consider all whitespace in an XML interchangable, and might collapse those linebreaks into a single space. That's why your XSLT has to jump through such hoops to render the data properly. Using a \"br\" tag would vastly simplify the transform. Another potential problem is that if you open up your XML document in an XML editor and pretty-print it, you're likely to lose those line breaks. If you do keep using linebreaks, make sure add an xml:space=\"preserve\" attribute to \"address.\" (You can do this in your DTD, if you're using one.) Some suggested reading An article from XML.com says the following: XML applications often seem to take a cavalier attitude toward whitespace because the rules about the places in an XML document where whitespace doesn't matter sometimes give these applications free rein to add or remove whitespace in certain places.

Secondly, I found a great way to avoid making tons of changes in old code is to just refactor it a little until you can test it. One easy way to do this is to make private members protected, and then override the protected field. For example, let's say you have a class that loads some stuff from the database during the constructor. In this case, you can't just override a protected method, but you can extract the DB logic to a protected field and then override it in the test. public class MyClass { public MyClass() { // undesirable DB logic } } becomes public class MyClass { public MyClass() { loadFromDB(); } protected void loadFromDB() { // undesirable DB logic } } and then your test looks something like this: public class MyClassTest { public void testSomething() { MyClass myClass = new MyClassWrapper(); // test it } private static class MyClassWrapper extends MyClass { @Override protected void loadFromDB() { // some mock logic } } } This is somewhat of a bad example, because you could use DBUnit in this case, but I actually did this in a similar case recently because I wanted to test some functionality totally unrelated to the data being loaded, so it was very effective. I've also found such exposing of members to be useful in other similar cases where I need to get rid of some dependency that has been in a class for a long time. I would recommend against this solution if you are writing a framework though, unless you really don't mind exposing the members to users of your framework. It's a bit of a hack, but I've found it quite useful. "}

You can either dump this into a file or pipe it straight into the database frontend. It's not pretty, but honestly, pretty hardly seems to be a major concern for things like this. This technique is quick to write, and it works. Those are my primary criteria for things like this. You might want to check out this thread, too.

No worries. If clustered \"slow\" transactions is a issue, then the queuing solution is the way to go. Depending on how fast or slow the average transaction is, you might also want to look at assigning multiple lines at a time to each worker. This will cut down on synchronization overhead. Likewise, you might need to optimize your buffer size. Of course, both of these are optimizations that you should probably only do after profiling. (No point in worrying about synchronization if it's not a bottleneck.) "}

Once he's done it a fair few times he'll get in the habit of testing stuff. I don't know if you need to block commits like that though. At my workplace everyone has free commit to everything, and all SVN commit messages (with diffs) are emailed to the team. Note: you really want the thunderbird colored-diffs addon if you plan on doing this. My boss or myself (the 2 'senior' coders) will end up reading over the commits, and if there's any stuff like \"you forgot to add unit tests\" we just flick an email or go and chat to the person, explaining why they needed unit tests or whatever. Everyone else is encouraged to read the commits too, as it's a great way of seeing what's going on, but the junior devs don't comment so much. You can help encourage people to get into the habit of this by periodically saying things like \"Hey, bob, did you see that commit I did this morning, I found this neat trick where you can do blah blah whatever, read the commit and see how it works!\" NB: We have 2 'senior' devs and 3 junior ones.

So it's relatively easy (if not a bit tedious) to add the missing text to the document. For example with Zend Framework: <?php require_once 'Zend/Pdf.php'; $pdf = Zend_Pdf::load('blank.pdf'); $page = $pdf->pages[0]; $font = Zend_Pdf_Font::fontWithName(Zend_Pdf_Font::FONT_HELVETICA); $page->setFont($font, 12); $page->drawText('Hello world!', 72, 720); $pdf->save('zend.pdf'); If you're trying to replace inline content, such as a \"[placeholder string],\" it gets much more complicated. While it's technically possible to do, you're likely to mess up the layout of the page.

Now I think it would look much nicer, if the textarea I'm using for the main address details would just take up the area of the text in it, and automatically resize if the text was changed. Here's a screenshot of it currently. Any ideas? @Chris A good point, but there are reasons I want it to resize. I want the area it takes up to be the area of the information contained in it. As you can see in the screen shot, if I have a fixed textarea, it takes up a fair wack of vertical space. I can reduce the font, but I need address to be large and readable. Now I can reduce the size of the text area, but then I have problems with people who have an address line that takes 3 or 4 (one takes 5) lines. Needing to have the user use a scrollbar is a major no-no. I guess I should be a bit more specific. I'm after vertical resizing, and the width doesn't matter as much. The only problem that happens with that, is the ISO number (the large \"1\") gets pushed under the address when the window width is too small (as you can see on the screenshot). It's not about having a gimick; it's about having a text field the user can edit that won't take up unnecessary space, but will show all the text in it. Though if someone comes up with another way to approach the problem I'm open to that too. I've modified the code a little because it was acting a little odd. I changed it to activate on keyup, because it wouldn't take into consideration the character that was just typed. resizeIt = function() { var str = $('iso_address').value; var cols = $('iso_address').cols; var linecount = 0; $A(str.split(\"\\n\")).each(function(l) { linecount += 1 + Math.floor(l.length / cols); // Take into account long lines }) $('iso_address').rows = linecount; }; "}

Imagine I have graduated school not that long ago, and never really had to write tests. Imagine I work in a company that doesn't really enforce or asks for this. OK? good! Now imagine, that the company is switching to using tests, and they are trying to get me inline with this. I will give somewhat snarky reaction to items mentioned so far, as if I didn't do any research on this. Let's get this started with the creator: Showing that the design becomes simpler. How can writing more, make things simpler. I would now have to keep tabs on getting more cases, and etc. This makes it more complicated if you ask me. Give me solid details. Showing it prevents defects. I know that. This is why they are called tests. My code is good, and I checked it for issues, so I don't see where those tests would help. Making it an ego thing saying only bad programmers don't. Ohh, so you think I am a bad programmer just because I don't do as much used testing. I'm insulted and positively annoyed at you. I would rather have assistance and support than sayings. @Justin Standard: On start of new propect pair the junior guy up with yourself or another senior programmer. Ohh, this is so important that resources will be spent making sure I see how things are done, and have some assist me on how things are done. This is helpful, and I might just start doing it more. @Justin Standard: Read Unit Testing 101 presentation by Kate Rhodes. Ahh, that was an interesting presentation, and it made me think about testing. It hammered some points in that I should consider, and it might have swayed my views a bit. I would love to see more compelling articles, and other tools to assist me in getting in line with thinking this is the right way to do things. @Dominic Cooney: Spend some time and share testing techniques. Ahh, this helps me understand what is expected of me as far as techniques, and it puts more items in my bag of knowledge, that I might use again. @Dominic Cooney: Answer questions, examples and books. Having a point person (people) to answer question is helpful, it might make me more likely to try. Good examples are great, and it gives me something to aim for, and something to look for reference. Books that are relevant to this directly are great reference. @Adam Hayle: Surprise Review. Say what, you sprung something that I am completely unprepared for. I feel uncomfortable with this, but will do my best. I will now be scared and mildly apprehensive of this coming up again, thank you. However, the scare tactic might have worked, but it does have a cost. However, if nothing else works, this might just be the push that is needed. @Rytmis: Items are only considered done when they have test cases. Ohh, interesting. I see I really do have to do this now, otherwise I'm not completing anything. This makes sense. @jmorris: Get Rid / Sacrifice. glares, glares, glares - There is a chance I might learn, and with support, and assistance, I can become a very important and functional part of the teams. This is one of my handicaps now, but it won't be for long. However, if I just don't get it, I understand that I will go. I think I will get it. In the end, the support of my team with play a large part in all this. Having a person take their time to assist, and get me started into good habits is always welcome. Then, afterward having a good support net would be great. It would always be appreciated to have someone come a few times afterward, and go over some code, to see how everything is flowing, not in a review per se, but more as a friendly visit.

We did some neat stuff with it... we were a web based telecom application, so one cool use I set up was to mimick dialing a number through our web application, then used an auto answer tool we had (which was basically a tutorial app from Microsoft to connect to their RTC LCS server... which is what Microsoft Office Communicator connects to on a local network... then modified to just pick up calls automatically). This then allowed us to use this instead of an expensive telephony tool called The Hammer (or something like that). Anyways, we also used the tool to see how our application held up under high load, and it was very effective in finding bottlenecks. The tool has built in reporting to show how long requests are taking, but we never used it. The logs can also store all the responses and whatnot, or custom logging. I highly recommend this tool, very useful for the price... but expect to do some custom setup with it (it has a built in proxy to record a script, but it may need customization for capturing something like sessions... I know I had to customize it to utilize a unique session per thread). "}

Can you please explain me MathContext in the context of BigDecimal#round method. There's nothing special about BigDecimal.round() vs. any other BigDecimal method. In all cases, the MathContext specifies the number of significant digits and the rounding technique. Basically, there are two parts of every MathContext. There's a precision, and there's also a RoundingMode. The precision again specifies the number of significant digits. So if you specify 123 as a number, and ask for 2 significant digits, you're going to get 120. It might be clearer if you think in terms of scientific notation. 123 would be 1.23e2 in scientific notation. If you only keep 2 significant digits, then you get 1.2e2, or 120. By reducing the number of significant digits, we reduce the precision with which we can specify a number. The RoundingMode part specifies how we should handle the loss of precision. To reuse the example, if you use 123 as the number, and ask for 2 significant digits, you've reduced your precision. With a RoundingMode of HALF_UP (the default mode), 123 will become 120. With a RoundingMode of CEILING, you'll get 130. For example: System.out.println(new BigDecimal(\"123.4\", new MathContext(4,RoundingMode.HALF_UP))); System.out.println(new BigDecimal(\"123.4\", new MathContext(2,RoundingMode.HALF_UP))); System.out.println(new BigDecimal(\"123.4\", new MathContext(2,RoundingMode.CEILING))); System.out.println(new BigDecimal(\"123.4\", new MathContext(1,RoundingMode.CEILING))); Outputs: 123.4 1.2E+2 1.3E+2 2E+2 You can see that both the precision and the rounding mode affect the output.

This can easily be done if you are acting on an object passed in to the constructor... just pass in a mock. If not, I tend to prefer to have the functionality moved to a protected method, and override the protected method to evoke my failure case. I will use Java as an example, but it should be easy enough to port the ideas to a C# case: public class MyClass { public MyClass() throws MyClassException { // Whatever, including a call to invokeCreateIoCompletionPort } protected int invokeCreateIoCompletionPort(String str, int i) { return StaticClass.createIoCompletionPort(str, i); } } public class MyTest { public void myTest() { try { new MyClass(); fail(\"MyClassException was not thrown!\"); } catch (MyClassException e) { } } private static class MyClassWrapper extends MyClass { @Override protected int invokeCreateIoCompletionPort(String str, int i) { throw new ExpectedException(); } } } As you can see, it is pretty easy to test whether an exception is being thrown by the constructor or method you are testing, and it is also pretty easy to inject an exception from an external class that can throw an exception. Sorry I'm not using your actual method, I just used the name to illustrate how it sounded like you are using it, and how I would test the cases it sounded you wanted to test.

An \"arithmetic\" shift leaves the original value in the leftmost bit. The difference becomes important when dealing with negative numbers.) When shifting an unsigned value, the >> operator in C is a logical shift. When shifting a signed value, the >> operator is an arithmetic shift.

So it sounds like it depends on your compiler. Also in that article, note that left shift is the same for arithmetic and logical. I would recommend doing a simple test with some signed and unsigned numbers on the border case (high bit set of course) and see what the result is on your compiler.

A table in a DB is really the set of that entity, it makes more sense once you're using set-logic: select Orders.* from Orders inner join Products on Orders.Key = Products.Key That last line, the actual logic of the join, looks confusing with plural table names. I'm not sure about always using an alias (as Matt suggests) clears that up. 2) They should be singular as they only hold 1 property 3) Never, if the column name is ambiguous (as above where they both have a column called [Key]) the name of the table (or its alias) can distinguish them well enough. You want queries to be quick to type and simple - prefixes add unnecessary complexity. 4) Whatever you want, I'd suggest CapitalCase I don't think there's one set of absolute guidelines on any of these.

The name of the Foriegn key field should be the same as the Primary key field. i.e. SELECT cust_nm, cust_add1, booking_dt FROM reg_customer INNER JOIN reg_booking ON reg_customer.cust_id = reg_booking.cust_id When developing a new project, I'd recommend you write out all the preferred entity names, prefixes and acronyms and give this document to your developers. Then, when they decide to create a new table, they can refer to the document rather than \"guess\" what the table and fields should be called. "}
{"user":"605","questionId":"7662","creationDate":"2008-08-11T12:27:27.670","answerId":"7715","type":"answer","body":"Naming conventions allow the development team to design discovereability and maintainability at the heart of the project. A good naming convention takes time to evolve but once it\u2019s in place it allows the team to move forward with a common language. A good naming convention grows organically with the project. A good naming convention easily copes with changes during the longest and most important phase of the software lifecycle - service management in production. Here are my answers: Yes, table names should be plural when they refer to a set of trades, securities, or counterparties for example. Yes. Yes. SQL tables are prefixed with tb_, views are prefixed vw_, stored procedures are prefixed usp_ and triggers are prefixed tg_ followed by the database name. Column name should be lower case separated by underscore. Naming is hard but in every organisation there is someone who can name things and in every software team there should be someone who takes responsibility for namings standards and ensures that naming issues like sec_id, sec_value and security_id get resolved early before they get baked into the project. So what are the basic tenets of a good naming convention and standards: - Use the language of your client and your solution domain Be descriptive Be consistent Disambiguate, reflect and refactor Don\u2019t use abbreviations unless they are clear to everyone Don\u2019t use SQL reserved keywords as column names "}

One thing you can do is to create a thread-local global variable where you write the ID of the current context. (This can be done with AOP.) Then in the singleton getter, the context ID is fetched from the thread-local to use as a key to the correct \"singleton\" instance for the calling context.

I know the inherited Control class has the event, but it's not exposed in TextBox. Is there a way to override the event handler? I also tried the OpenNETCF TextBox2 control which does have the MouseDown event exposed, but no matter what I do, it doesn't fire the handler. Any suggestions? What kind of crazy mobile device do you have that has a mouse? :) Yes, windows mobile does not have an actual mouse, but you are mistaken that Windows Mobile .NET does not support the Mouse events. A click or move on the screen is still considered a \"Mouse\" event. It was done this way so that code could port over from full Windows easily. And this is not a Windows Mobile specific issue. The TextBox control on Windows does not have native mouse events either. I just happened to be using Windows Mobile in this case. Edit: And on a side note...as Windows Mobile is built of the WindowsCE core which is often used for embedded desktop systems and Slim Terminal Services clients or \"WinTerms\" it has support for a hardware mouse and has for a long time. Most devices just don't have the ports to plug one in. According to the .Net Framework, the MouseDown Event Handler on a TextBox is supported. What happens when you try to run the code? Actually, that's only there because it inherits it from \"Control\", as does every other Form control. It is however, overridden (and changed to private I believe) in the TextBox class. So it will not show up in IntelliSense in Visual Studio. However, you actually can write the code: textBox1.MouseDown += new System.Windows.Forms.MouseEventHandler(this.textBox1_MouseDown); and it will compile and run just fine, the only problem is that textBox1_MouseDown() will not be fired when you tap the TextBox control. I assume this is because of the Event being overridden internally. I don't even want to change what's happening on the event internally, I just want to add my own event handler to that event so I can fire some custom code as you could with any other event. "}

The entire file must be transferred before playback can begin. Changing the video requires rebuilding the SWF file.[citation needed] Progressive download via HTTP (supported in Flash Player 7 and later). This method uses ActionScript to include an externally hosted Flash Video file client-side for playback. Progressive download has several advantages, including buffering, use of generic HTTP servers, and the ability to reuse a single SWF player for multiple Flash Video sources. Flash Player 8 includes support for random access within video files using the partial download functionality of HTTP, sometimes this is referred to as streaming. However, unlike streaming using RTMP, HTTP \"streaming\" does not support real-time broadcasting. Streaming via HTTP requires a custom player and the injection of specific Flash Video metadata containing the exact starting position in bytes and timecode of each keyframe. Using this specific information, a custom Flash Video player can request any part of the Flash Video file starting at a specified keyframe. For example, Google Video and Youtube support progressive downloading and can seek to any part of the video before buffering is complete. The server-side part of this \"HTTP pseudo-streaming\" method is fairly simple to implement, for example in PHP, as an Apache HTTPD module, or a lighttpd module. Rich Media Project provides players and Flash components compatible with \"HTTP pseudo-streaming\" method. Streamed via RTMP to the Flash Player using the Flash Media Server (formerly called Flash Communication Server), VCS, ElectroServer, Wowza Pro or the open source Red5 server. As of April 2008, there are four stream recorders available for this protocol, re-encoding screencast software excluded. There is a useful introduction from Adobe here: Flash video learning guide "}

Your question is frequently asked: % perldoc -q duplicate The answer, copy and pasted from the output of the command above, appears below: Found in /usr/local/lib/perl5/5.10.0/pods/perlfaq4.pod How can I remove duplicate elements from a list or array? (contributed by brian d foy) Use a hash. When you think the words \"unique\" or \"duplicated\", think \"hash keys\". If you don't care about the order of the elements, you could just create the hash then extract the keys. It's not important how you create that hash: just that you use \"keys\" to get the unique elements. my %hash = map { $_, 1 } @array; # or a hash slice: @hash{ @array } = (); # or a foreach: $hash{$_} = 1 foreach ( @array ); my @unique = keys %hash; If you want to use a module, try the \"uniq\" function from \"List::MoreUtils\". In list context it returns the unique elements, preserving their order in the list. In scalar context, it returns the number of unique elements. use List::MoreUtils qw(uniq); my @unique = uniq( 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 5, 7 ); # 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 my $unique = uniq( 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 5, 7 ); # 7 You can also go through each element and skip the ones you've seen before. Use a hash to keep track. The first time the loop sees an element, that element has no key in %Seen. The \"next\" statement creates the key and immediately uses its value, which is \"undef\", so the loop continues to the \"push\" and increments the value for that key. The next time the loop sees that same element, its key exists in the hash and the value for that key is true (since it's not 0 or \"undef\"), so the next skips that iteration and the loop goes to the next element. my @unique = (); my %seen = (); foreach my $elem ( @array ) { next if $seen{ $elem }++; push @unique, $elem; } You can write this more briefly using a grep, which does the same thing. my %seen = (); my @unique = grep { ! $seen{ $_ }++ } @array; "}

Given a document with a lot of seperate pieces like the ones in DannySmurfs example, it should be fairly easy. Some rough code in Pseudo C# : int nrOfPieces = 5; XmlDocument xmlOriginal = some input parameter.. // construct the list we need, and fill it with XmlDocuments.. var xmlList = new List<XmlDocument>(); for (int i = 0; i < nrOfPieces ; i++) { var xmlDoc = new XmlDocument(); xmlDoc.ChildNodes.Add(new XmlNode(xmlOriginal.FistNode.Name)); xmlList.Add(xmlDoc); } var nodeList = xmlOriginal.GetElementsByTagName(\"Piece\")M // Copy the nodes from the original into the pieces.. for (int i = 0; i < nodeList .Count; i++) { var xmlDoc = xmlList[i % nrOfPieces]; var nodeToCopy = nodeList[i].Clone(); xmlDoc.FirstNode.ChildNodes.Add(nodeToCopy); } This should give you n docs with correct xml and the possibility to merge them back together.

In my experience, though, if you're just reading the file, doing some processing (i.e., breaking it up) and then continuing on with your work, the XmlDocument is going to go through it's create/read/collect cycle so quickly that it likely won't matter. Of course, that depends on what a \"large\" file is. If it's a 30 MB XML file (which I would consider large for an XML file), it probably won't make any difference. If it's a 500 MB XML file, using XmlDocument will become extremely problematic on systems without a significant amount of RAM (in that case, however, I'd argue that the time to manually pick through the file with a XmlReader would be the more significant impediment).

The problem with a classic example is that you are forced to close the file by yourself, meaning that you will have to bend your architecture to this need. RAII makes use of the automatic destructor call in C++ to close the file for you. Update: seems that std::fstream already implements RAII so the code below is useless. I'll keep it here for posterity and as an example of RAII. class FileOpener { public: FileOpener(std::fstream& file, const char* fileName): m_file(file) { m_file.open(fileName); } ~FileOpeneer() { file.close(); } private: std::fstream& m_file; }; You can now use this class in your code like this: int nsize = 10; char *somedata; ifstream myfile; FileOpener opener(myfile, \"<path to file>\"); myfile.read(somedata,nsize); // myfile is closed automatically when opener destructor is called Learning how RAII works can save you some headaches and some major memory management bugs.

That's because the select element is considered an ActiveX object and is on top of every HTML element in the page. I already saw people hiding selects when opening a popup div, that leads to pretty bad user experience having controls disappearing. FogBugz actually had a pretty smart solution (before v6) of turning every select into text boxes when a popup was displayed. This solved the bug and tricked the user eye but the behavior was not perfect. Another solution is in FogBugz 6 where they no more use the select element and recoded it everywhere. Last solution I currently use is messing up the IE rendering engine and force it to render the absolutely positioned <div> as an ActiveX element too, ensuring it can live over a select element. This is achieved by placing an invisible <iframe> inside the <div> and styling it with: #MyDiv iframe { position: absolute; z-index: -1; filter: mask(); border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 9999px; height: 9999px; overflow: hidden; } Does anyone have an even better solution than this one?

I would say that there are mainly four different families of text editors: classic menubar-based editors like WinEdit, Gedit or BBEdit Emacs and its brethren XEmacs, Aquamacs etc. VI / Vim / Cream and the like TextMate and E You can differenciate between these families by their different paradigms of usage: Classic editors rely mainly on a menubar and some Ctrl-key shortcuts. Emacs-style editing uses highly sophisticated keyboard commands like C-x-s and even whole words to evoke commands. VI is modebased and is operated by single-key commands or whole words. TextMate is based on Snippets and classic shortcuts. Emacs and TextMate are also easily extensible by user-created scripts in Lisp (Emacs) or any other command-line-language (TextMate). (Classic editors and VI are also extendable, but the effort is usually considerably bigger) I would recommend that everyone tried at least one good example of each of these families (if possible) and find out what suits them best.

Either the NORECOVERY or STANDBY option must be specified if another transaction log has to be applied. If neither NORECOVERY, RECOVERY, or STANDBY is specified, RECOVERY is the default. SQL Server requires that the WITH NORECOVERY option be used on all but the final RESTORE statement when restoring a database backup and multiple transaction logs, or when multiple RESTORE statements are needed (for example, a full database backup followed by a differential database backup). Note When specifying the NORECOVERY option, the database is not usable in this intermediate, nonrecovered state. When used with a file or filegroup restore operation, NORECOVERY forces the database to remain in the restoring state after the restore operation. This is useful in either of these situations: A restore script is being run and the log is always being applied. A sequence of file restores is used and the database is not intended to be usable between two of the restore operations. RECOVERY Instructs the restore operation to roll back any uncommitted transactions. After the recovery process, the database is ready for use. If subsequent RESTORE operations (RESTORE LOG, or RESTORE DATABASE from differential) are planned, NORECOVERY or STANDBY should be specified instead. If neither NORECOVERY, RECOVERY, or STANDBY is specified, RECOVERY is the default. When restoring backup sets from an earlier version of SQL Server, a database upgrade may be required. This upgrade is performed automatically when WITH RECOVERY is specified. For more information, see Transaction Log Backups . STANDBY = undo_file_name Specifies the undo file name so the recovery effects can be undone. The size required for the undo file depends on the volume of undo actions resulting from uncommitted transactions. If neither NORECOVERY, RECOVERY, or STANDBY is specified, RECOVERY is the default. STANDBY allows a database to be brought up for read-only access between transaction log restores and can be used with either warm standby server situations or special recovery situations in which it is useful to inspect the database between log restores. If the specified undo file name does not exist, SQL Server creates it. If the file does exist, SQL Server overwrites it. The same undo file can be used for consecutive restores of the same database. For more information, see Using Standby Servers. Important If free disk space is exhausted on the drive containing the specified undo file name, the restore operation stops. STANDBY is not allowed when a database upgrade is necessary. "}

What I usually do when I have to do something like this is to first replace all separating quotes and (usually) semicolons by tabs. Search: \";\" Replace: \\t Since I know in which column my affected values will be I then do another search and replace: Search: ^([\\t]+)\\t([\\t]+)\\t([0-9]+),([0-9]+)\\t Replace: \\1\\t\\2\\t\\3\\4\\t ... given the value with the comma is in the third column. You need to start with an \"^\" to make sure that it starts at the beginning of a line. Then you repeat ([0-9]+)\\t as often as there are columns that you just want to leave as they are. ([0-9]+),([0-9]+) searches for values where there is a number, then a comma and then another number. In the replace string we use \\1 and \\2 to just keep the values from the edited line, separating them with \\t (tab). Then we put \\3\\4 (no tab between) to put the two components of the number without the comma right after each other. All values after that will be left alone. If you need your file to have semicolon to separate the elements, you then can go on and replace the tabs with semicolons. However then - if you leave out the quotes - you'll have to make sure that the text values do not contain any semicolons themselves. That's why I prefer to use TAB as column separator. I usually do that in an ordinary text editor (EditPlus) that supports RegExp, but the same regexps can be used in any programming language. "}

{"user":"993","questionId":"7954","creationDate":"2008-08-11T18:10:27.133","answerId":"8034","type":"answer","body":"GateKiller, In simple terms (and not a copy-paste out of the SQLBOL) so you can understand the concepts: RESTORE WITH RECOVERY uses the backup media file (eg. fulldata.bak) to restore the database to back to the time that backup file was created. In this case, the restore sequence can restore other backups and roll them forward. This is great if you want to go back in time to restore the database to an earlier state - like when developing a system. If you want to restore the database TO THE VERY LATEST DATA, (i.e. like if your doing a system Disaster Recovery and you cannot lose any data) then you want to restore that backup AND THEN all the transaction logs created since that backup. This is when you use RESTORE NORECOVERY. It will allow you to restore the later transaction logs right up to the point of failure (as long as you have them). RECOVERY WITH STANDBY is the ability to restore the database up to a parital date (like NORECOVERY above) but to allow the database still to be used READONLY. New transaction logs can still be applied to the database to keep it up to date (a standby server). Use this when it would take too long to restore a full database in order to Return To Operations the system. (ie. if you have a multi TB database that would take 16 hours to restore, but could receive transaction log updates every 15 minutes). This is a bit like a mirror server - but without having \"every single transaction\" send to the backup server in real time. "}

For instance in .Net 2.0 public interface IHaveChildren { string ParentType { get; } int ParentId { get; } List<IChild> GetChildren() } Can (in 3.5) become: public interface IHaveChildren { string ParentType { get; } int ParentId { get; } } public static class HaveChildrenExtension { public static List<IChild> GetChildren( this IHaveChildren ) { //logic to get children by parent type and id //shared for all classes implementing IHaveChildren } } This seems to me to be a better mechanism for many interfaces. They no longer need an abstract base to share this code, and functionally the code works the same. This could make code more maintainable and easier to test. The only disadvantage being that an abstract bases implementation can be virtual, but can that be worked around (would an instance method hide an extension method with the same name? would it be confusing code to do so?) Any other reasons not to regularly use this pattern? Clarification: Yeah, I see the tendency with extension methods is to end up with them everywhere. I'd be particularly careful having any on .Net value types without a great deal of peer review (I think the only one we have on string is a .SplitToDictionary() - similar to .Split() but taking a key-value delimiter too) I think there's a whole best practice debate there ;-) (Incidentally: DannySmurf, your PM sounds scary.) I'm specifically asking here about using extension methods where previously we had interface methods. I'm trying to avoid lots of levels of abstract base classes - the classes implementing these models mostly already have base classes. I think this model could be more maintainable and less overly-coupled than adding further object hierarchies. Is this what MS have done to IEnumerable and IQueryable for Linq? "}

LINQ is built on a lot of foundation, and C# in Depth builds it up from the ground. The second book is a whole lot better than nothing, and you will learn things specifically about LINQ that you won't learn in the first. But the first book will give you much better foundation, and puts up at least a token perspective instead of more or less blindly following the MS line. So, I'm recommending C# in Depth first and foremost for learning LINQ. Mike "}
{"user":"667","questionId":"8050","creationDate":"2008-08-11T18:43:51.420","answerId":"8081","type":"answer","body":"Linq is short for \"Language integrated query.\" It's a set of language enhancements built into C# and VB. Basically, what you get is a bunch of standard query operators that can be applied to any IEnumerable of type T. There's a lot of different linq providers for specific types of data- for example, there's linq to xml, linq to entities, even linq to sharepoint. To get started with linq, in all its many forms, I suggest the book Pro Linq by Joseph C. Rattz. It's an excellent overview of Linq. He takes a ground-up approach, first describing all the language features (like Lambda Expressions and Expression Trees) that Linq is built on, and then moving on to some standard linq provider implementations. Additionally, here's a pretty good MSDN article describing Linq: LINQ: .NET Language-Integrated Query Now, Linq to Sql is a linq provider written specifically for SQL Server. Included in this provider is an OR/M, that gives you some handy-dandy functionality (like typing out all your sql tables, so you get a robust design-time view of your database schema.) It's totally awesome, and for me, has greatly speed up development time when working with a sql database. The book I recommended above also has a great section about using Linq To Sql. Also, here's a good \"beginner's guide\" article from MSDN: Linq To SQL: .NET Language-Integrated Query for Relational Data "}

My understanding is that you are breaking a page down into set of \"composite\" user controls that contain other controls, and you want to decide whether to use properties for setting values. I guess this really depends on how the user controls are designed and whether they are being dynamically added to a page etc (one possible scenario). I have a personal preference for specifying stuff in a constructor or using a factory method to create controls. I assume responsibility at creation for making sure that everything is set. My experience with properties is that I'll sometimes forget to set something and not realize my mistake. Your point about setting properties or using a sub, and everything being populated doesn't make a lot of sense to me. If you have some sort of dependency and need something else to be loaded then this could happen irrespective of whether it's a property or sub. I would refer to any book on VB.NET/C#/OOP to see the syntax for interfaces. Interfaces basically describe a contract for a class. If you have class A and B and both implement an interface called ITime then both will provide all of the methods defined on ITime. They can still add their own methods but they must at minimum include an implementation of ITime's methods (eg. we might have GetDate(), GetCurrentTime() as methods on ITime). An interface doesn't tell class A or B how those methods should work - just their name, parameters and return type. Lookup inheritance in an OOP book for more information on how interfaces inheritance is different from implementation inheritance. "}

One tier for UI, one for business logic, and for persisting data. The last one you say? Domain objects and interfaces. This makes it possible to load up any one or two of the main tiers plus the domain \"tier\", and the code should work. It relies heavily on dependency injection and Inversion of Control principles. The data/persistence tier does only two things. It creates, reads, updates and deletes data, and maps it to the domain object format. The UI tier does the exact opposite. It displays and receives data in a way that the user can relate to, and maps that output/input to and from the domain object format. The business logic tier just need to know one thing. Business logic. It does not care about where the data is from, and it does not care about where the data tier is putting it. It knows that it should flag an account that was just overdrawn, how to physically do that is not part of its job really. The domain objects themselves does not have any logic, they are just containers for passing data between the tiers. This means that you can load the domain objects and interfaces without having to think at all about dependencies.

Then make one or more Interfaces that the writer must implement for your code to know when and where to execute the code. Make an API the writer can use to access some of the functionality in your code. You could also make a base class the writer must inherit. This will make wiring up the API easier. Then use some kind of reflection to scan a directory, and load the classes you find that matches your requirements. Some people also make a scripting language for their system, or implements an interpreter for a subset of an existing language. This is also a possible route to go. Bottom line is: When you get the code to load, only your imagination should be able to stop you. Good luck. "}

If, for example, you had a program written in C, for Windows, plugins would be written for your program as DLLs. At runtime, you would manually load these DLLs, and expose some interface to them. For example, the DLLs might expose a gimme_the_interface() function which could accept a structure filled with function pointers. These function pointers would allow the DLL to make calls, register callbacks, etc. If you were in C++, you would use the DLL system, except you would probably pass an object pointer instead of a struct, and the object would implement an interface which provided functionality (accomplishing the same thing as the struct, but less ugly). For Java, you would load class files on-demand instead of DLLs, but the basic idea would be the same. In all cases, you'll need to define a standard interface between your code and the plugins, so that you can initialize the plugins, and so the plugins can interact with you. P.S. If you'd like to see a good example of a C++ plugin system, check out the foobar2000 SDK. I haven't used it in quite a while, but it used to be really well done. I assume it still is. "}

You'd use the relevant patterns, but the specific implementation depends on your platform/language choice.

Although you could, like Eldila, use a regular expression for a find and then an alternative solution for replace. Also be careful with s/\"(\\d+),(\\d+)\"/$1$2/ because what if the number has more then just a single comma, for instance \"1,000,000\" you're going to want to do a global replace (in perl that is s///g). But even with a global replace the replacement starts where you last left off (unless perl is different), and would miss the every other comma separated group. A possible solution would be to make the first (\\d+) optional like so s/(\\d+)?,(\\d+)/$1$2/g and in this case I would need a second find and replace to strip the quotes. Here are some ruby examples of the regular expressions acting on just the string \"1,000,000\", notice there are NOT double quote inside the string, this is just a string of the number itself. >> \"1,000,000\".sub( /(\\d+),(\\d+)/, '\\1\\2' ) # => \"1000,000\" >> \"1,000,000\".gsub( /(\\d+),(\\d+)/, '\\1\\2' ) # => \"1000,000\" >> \"1,000,000\".gsub( /(\\d+)?,(\\d+)/, '\\1\\2' ) # => \"1000000\" >> \"1,000,000\".gsub( /[,\"]/, '' ) # => \"1000000\" >> \"1,000,000\".gsub( /[^0-9]/, '' ) # => \"1000000\" "}

EDIT: Ryan Fox's comments on the exceptional case is perfect, I concur As for performance, it depends on the indexer on the collection. C# lets you override the indexer operator, so if it is doing a for loop like the contains method you would write, then it will be just as slow (with maybe a few nanoseconds slower due to the try/catch... but nothing to worry about unless that code itself is within a huge loop). If the indexer is O(1) (or even O(log(n))... or anything faster than O(n)), then the try/catch solution would be faster of course.

Whilst some people might be happy to say that looping through the collection is less efficient to throwing an exception, there is an overhead to throwing an exception. I would also question why you are using a collection to access an item by key when you would be better suited to using a dictionary or hashtable. My main problem with this code however, is that regardless of the type of exception thrown, you are always going to be left with the same result. For example, an exception could be thrown because the object doesn't exist in the collection, or because the collection itself is null or because you can't cast myCollect[myObject] to aObject. All of these exceptions will get handled in the same way, which may not be your intention. These are a couple of nice articles on when and where it is usally considered acceptable to throw exceptions: Foundations of Programming Throwing exceptions in c# I particularly like this quote from the second article: It is important that exceptions are thrown only when an unexpected or invalid activity occurs that prevents a method from completing its normal function. Exception handling introduces a small overhead and lowers performance so should not be used for normal program flow instead of conditional processing. It can also be difficult to maintain code that misuses exception handling in this way. "}

A second reason is that unless you are very atypical, your production server will likely be running linux too.

I have a table that has a conditional visibility expression, and I need a page break at the end of the table. If I set the PageBreakAtEnd property to true. It is ignored no matter what. Remove the visibility condition and it works. If I place the table inside a rectangle with the conditional visibility on the table, and the page break on the table. Same result. The page break property is ignored. If I set the rectangle with the PageBreakAtEnd property and the table with the visibility condition, then I still get a page break even when the table isn't shown. Any other ideas on what to try? I'm almost at the point where I need a separate report rather than conditional visibility :( Edit: @Josh: That has the same problems. If the second table has conditional visibility it doesn't work. If it doesn't have the visibility expression, then I get the page break all the time. @Erick: I really wanted that to be the answer but unfortunately it doesn't work. When the visibility expression evaluates to hidden, there's a big gap where the rectangles would be (which I can live with), and when it evaluates to visible, the page breaks still don't work. "}

The puzzled student replied that he liked okonomiyaki and kanten, but while his favorite restaurant served great okonomiyaki, their kanten always gave him a stomach ache the following morning. So Jacques took the student to eat at a restaurant that served okonomiyaki every bit as good as the student's favorite, then took him across town to a shop that made excellent kanten where the student happily applied the remainder of his appetite. The student was sated, but he was not enlightened ... until the next morning when he woke up and his stomach felt fine. My examples will cover using it for the reuse and encapsulation of code. This is fairly obvious once you look at these and should give you a concrete, simple example that you can think of applying in numerous situations. We want to do a map over a tree. This function could be curried and applied to each node if it needs more then one argument -- since we'd be applying the one at the node as it's final argument. It doesn't have to be curried, but writing another function (assuming this function is being used in other instances with other variables) would be a waste. type 'a tree = E of 'a | N of 'a * 'a tree * 'a tree let rec tree_map f tree = match tree with | N(x,left,right) -> N(f x, tree_map f left, tree_map f right) | E(x) -> E(f x) let sample_tree = N(1,E(3),E(4) let multiply x y = x * y let sample_tree2 = tree_map (multiply 3) sample_tree but this is the same as: let sample_tree2 = tree_map (fun x -> x * 3) sample_tree So this simple case isn't convincing. It really is though, and powerful once you use the language more and naturally come across these situations. The other example with some code reuse as currying. A recurrence relation to create prime numbers. Awful lot of similarity in there: let rec f_recurrence f a seed n = match n with | a -> seed | _ -> let prev = f_recurrence f a seed (n-1) in prev + (f n prev) let rowland = f_recurrence gcd 1 7 let cloitre = f_recurrence lcm 1 1 let rowland_prime n = (rowland (n+1)) - (rowland n) let cloitre_prime n = ((cloitre (n+1))/(cloitre n)) - 1 Ok, now rowland and cloitre are curried functions, since they have free variables, and we can get any index of it's sequence without knowing or worrying about f_recurrence.

{"user":"483","questionId":"8452","creationDate":"2008-08-12T04:58:38.620","answerId":"8471","type":"answer","body":"Ah ha! A question I can answer! Firstly, I should mention that I have personally found it easier to define and hook up commands in code rather than in XAML. It allows me to hook up the handlers for the commands a little more flexibly than an all XAML approach does. You should work out what commands you want to have and what they relate to. In my application, I currently have a class for defining important application commands like so: public static class CommandBank { /// Command definition for Closing a window public static RoutedUICommand CloseWindow { get; private set; } /// Static private constructor, sets up all application wide commands. static CommandBank() { CloseWindow = new RoutedUICommand(); CloseWindow.InputGestures.Add(new KeyGesture(Key.F4, ModifierKeys.Alt)); // ... } Now, because I wanted to keep the code all together, using a code only approach to Commands lets me put the following methods in the class above: /// Closes the window provided as a parameter public static void CloseWindowExecute(object sender, ExecutedRoutedEventArgs e) { ((Window)e.Parameter).Close(); } /// Allows a Command to execute if the CommandParameter is not a null value public static void CanExecuteIfParameterIsNotNull(object sender, CanExecuteRoutedEventArgs e) { e.CanExecute = e.Parameter != null; e.Handled = true; } The second method there can even be shared with other Commands without me having to repeat it all over the place. Once you have defined the commands like this, you can add them to any piece of UI. In the following, once the Window has Loaded, I add command bindings to both the Window and MenuItem and then add an input binding to the Window using a loop to do this for all command bindings. The parameter that is passed is the Window its self so the code above knows what Window to try and close. public partial class SimpleWindow : Window { private void WindowLoaded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e) { // ... this.CommandBindings.Add( new CommandBinding( CommandBank.CloseWindow, CommandBank.CloseWindowExecute, CommandBank.CanExecuteIfParameterIsNotNull)); foreach (CommandBinding binding in this.CommandBindings) { RoutedCommand command = (RoutedCommand)binding.Command; if (command.InputGestures.Count > 0) { foreach (InputGesture gesture in command.InputGestures) { var iBind = new InputBinding(command, gesture); iBind.CommandParameter = this; this.InputBindings.Add(iBind); } } } // menuItemExit is defined in XAML menuItemExit.Command = CommandBank.CloseWindow; menuItemExit.CommandParameter = this; // ... } // .... } I then also later have event handlers for the WindowClosing and WindowClosed events, I do recommend you make the actual implementation of commands as small and generic as possible. As in this case, I didn't try to put code that tries to stop the Window closing if there is unsaved data, I kept that code firmly inside the WindowClosing event. Let me know if you have any follow up questions. :) "}

Such collections are usually manipulated using bitwise operators, for example: myProperties.AllowedColors = MyColor.Red | MyColor.Green | MyColor.Blue; Note that [Flags] by itself doesn't change this at all - all it does is enable a nice representation by the .ToString() method: enum Suits { Spades = 1, Clubs = 2, Diamonds = 4, Hearts = 8 } [Flags] enum SuitsFlags { Spades = 1, Clubs = 2, Diamonds = 4, Hearts = 8 } ... var str1 = (Suits.Spades | Suits.Diamonds).ToString(); // \"5\" var str2 = (SuitsFlags.Spades | SuitsFlags.Diamonds).ToString(); // \"Spades, Diamonds\" It is also important to note that [Flags] does not automatically make the enum values powers of two. If you omit the numeric values, the enum will not work as one might expect in bitwise operations, because by default the values start with 0 and increment. Incorrect declaration: [Flags] public enum MyColors { Yellow, Green, Red, Blue } The values, if declared this way, will be Yellow = 0, Green = 1, Red = 2, Blue = 3. This will render it useless for use as flags. Here's an example of a correct declaration: [Flags] public enum MyColors { Yellow = 1, Green = 2, Red = 4, Blue = 8 } To retrieve the distinct values in you property one can do this if((myProperties.AllowedColors & MyColor.Yellow) == MyColor.Yellow) { // Yellow has been set... } if((myProperties.AllowedColors & MyColor.Green) == MyColor.Green) { // Green has been set... } or, in .NET 4 and later, if (myProperties.AllowedColors.HasFlag(MyColor.Yellow)) { // Yellow has been set... } Under the covers This works because you previously used powers of two in you enumeration. Under the covers your enumeration values looks like this (presented as bytes, which has 8 bits which can be 1's or 0's) Yellow: 00000001 Green: 00000010 Red: 00000100 Blue: 00001000 Likewise, after you've set your property AllowedColors to Red, Green and Blue (which values where OR'ed by the pipe |), AllowedColors looks like this myProperties.AllowedColors: 00001110 So when you retrieve the value you are actually bitwise AND'ing the values myProperties.AllowedColors: 00001110 MyColor.Green: 00000010 ----------------------- 00000010 // Hey, this is the same as MyColor.Green! The None = 0 value And regarding use 0 in you enumeration, quoting from msdn: [Flags] public enum MyColors { None = 0, .... } Use None as the name of the flag enumerated constant whose value is zero. You cannot use the None enumerated constant in a bitwise AND operation to test for a flag because the result is always zero. However, you can perform a logical, not a bitwise, comparison between the numeric value and the None enumerated constant to determine whether any bits in the numeric value are set. You can find more info about the flags attribute and its usage at msdn and designing flags at msdn "}

The colo will obviously be more expensive than sticking a server in your parents' closet. Quality. The colo should be a lot more reliable than the server in your parents' closet.

It is a lot easier to fix a broken box when you can walk over to it and plug up a monitor. Going to the colo to troubleshoot is probably not going to be convenient, if it's even possible. Transferring files from your laptop to the server in the closet is also going to be a lot faster than transferring over the Internet. On the other hand, if it's your box in the closet, you have to deal with the hardware problems, so it can balance out. Personally, I pay for a (shared) server. I find that having someone else handle the server is worth it. Uploading large files can get really frustrating, but having to maintain an extra box in the closet is too much hassle for me.

I need to interact with controls on other forms. I am trying to access the controls by using, for example, the following... otherForm.Controls[\"nameOfControl\"].Visible = false; It doesn't work the way I would expect. I end up with an exception thrown from Main. However, if I make the controls public instead of private, I can then access them directly, as so... otherForm.nameOfControl.Visible = false; But is that the best way to do it? Is making the controls public on the other form considered \"best practice\"? Is there a \"better\" way to access controls on another form? Further Explanation: This is actually a sort of follow-up to another question I asked, Best method for creating a \u201ctree-view preferences dialog\u201d type of interface in C#?. The answer I got was great and solved many, many organizational problems I was having in terms of keeping the UI straight and easy to work with both in run-time and design-time. However, it did bring up this one niggling issue of easily controlling other aspects of the interface. Basically, I have a root form that instantiates a lot of other forms that sit in a panel on the root form. So, for instance, a radio button on one of those sub-forms might need to alter the state of a status strip icon on the main, root form. In that case, I need the sub-form to talk to the control in the status strip of the parent (root) form. (I hope that makes sense, not in a \"who's on first\" kind of way.) "}

Say you have several classes and UI's all of which had commands that were never disabled, you'd have to write a 'CanAlwaysExecute' method for each Window or UserControl! That's just not very DRY. Having read several blogs and through trying several things, I've made the choice to make XAML purely about looks, styles, animation and triggers. All my hooking up of event handlers and commanding is now down in the code-behind. :) Another gotcha by the way is Input binding, in order for them to be caught, focus must be on the object that contains the Input bindings. For example, to have a short cut you can use at any time (say, F1 to open help), that input binding must be set on the Window object, since that always has focus when your app is Active. Using the code method should make that easier, even when you start using UserControls which might want to add input bindings to their parent Window. "}

(Correct memory allocation in C++ seems to causes problems with a lot of newer programmers these days) Based on the brief information provided, would a language such as python provide the required functionality and performance, as well as addressing the memory allocation (and various other C++ related) problems which arise? I like the idea of not needing to compile the programs each time we make a change. I understand that the interpreted languages probably wont hit the same performance we currently get. Our systems are Linux based which also restrict some options. Any comments on the functionality and performance available with Python or suggestions of alternative languages would be much appreciated. "}

The problem I assume you are running into with the existing running totals is that they are intended to follow each of the groups that they are totaling. Since you seem to want the subtotals to follow after all of the 'raw' data this won't work. If you create your own formulas for each group that simply adds on the total from those rows matching the group you should be able to place them at the end of the report. The downside to this approach is that the resulting subtotals will not be dynamic in relationship to the groups. In other words if you had a new 'source' it would not show up in the subtotals until you added it or if you had no 'dog walking' data you would still have a subtotal for it. "}

I figured someone else had already started on this track and decided that I could probably leech on their newfound knowledge :) So, does anyone have any pointers? I'm well aware of the problem that the more such a template/framework makes a web app look like a native iPhone app, the more likely I'm going to get into trouble because it just isn't, but for now I want a framework I can start building on, and then in the process figure out how to make it distinctive enough to be perceived as a web app as well as looking like a native iPhone application. Specifically I'm looking for features like: stylesheets set up, or pointers to how to do them for iPhone page flipping animation, ie. pick an item in a list, list scrolls out of view to the left and information for item scrolls in from the right the animation part would have to work with dynamic pages, ie. not just one big page that has divs set up for each sub-item, which at least one such framework had as a sort of quick fix, I would need to have list item picking load the page for that item, and then when loaded, scroll to it Edit: To avoid people reading only the question and answering, before reading my other reply, I'll add my clarification for GPL licensing and similar issues here. The framework I need to use can not be distributed under a license which would require me to license my own project out under a similar license. The GPL family of licenses allows for exceptions regarding library usage, but this won't apply to this since by necessity, the kind of framework I would need to use would be all source code. The project can easily accomodate commercial libraries. Also, I don't need a library or a framework as such, example files that look good and aren't overly obfuscated would be welcome as well. "}

If you're dealing with large numbers of large files then you may be better off staying in C++ and teaching your graduate programmers what a pointer is (!) Otherwise I'd strongly advise that you look at a scripting-based solution, because development in these, once you're up to speed, is so much faster. And a lot more fun, if we're honest, for most people at least. If the per-record processing load is not high, you may be surprised how little performance you lose: file IO will almost certainly be handled in a compiled (C) library, so the interpreter overhead may be relatively low. Worth trying, I'd suggest. Of the imperative languages, Perl is an obvious option, Python is popular and Ruby has a high profile (and probably cleaner OO features than the first two).

Understanding those takes time and practice, so I'd strongly recommend a small pet project in a local repository, so you can experiment.

For hashtable: foreach(object key in h.keys) { string keyAsString = key.ToString(); // btw, this is unnecessary string valAsString = h[key].ToString(); System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(keyAsString + \" \" + valAsString); } For dictionary: foreach(string key in d.keys) { string valAsString = d[key].ToString(); System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(key + \" \" + valAsString); } And just the same for the other one with KeyValuePair, just use the non-generic version for Hashtable, and the generic version for Dictionary. So it's just as easy both ways, but Hashtable uses Object for both key and value, which means you will box all value types, and you don't have type safety, and Dictionary uses generic types and is thus better.

Snort (www.snort.org) based IDSes are excellent, and there are some free fully packaged versions available. One I have used is StrataGuard (http://sgfree.stillsecure.com/), and it can be configured as an IDS (Intrusion Detection System) or as an IPS (Intrusion Prevention System). It's free to use if your traffic does not exceed 5Mbps. If you do go with an IDS/IPS I'd advise you to let it run as a simple IDS for a month or so, before you allow it to prevent attacks. This may be overkill, but if you have a spare machine lying around it can't hurt to have an IDS running passively. "}

I wouldnt' spend a lot of time on this though and you don't necessarily need to do this first if you are going to chose WPF. I just think it's good to have a basic understanding of this. There was a good podcast recently on .Net Rocks called \"Kate Gregory Develops in C++ for Vista!\" on there she recommends that someone starting out now should not use/learn MFC (even though it has been recently updated). As far as getting ready for the future you need to learn WPF, but it isn't complete yet, so depending on the kinds of client side apps you want to create, you will probably need to learn WinForms. The majority of people aren't using WPF yet, so it's a good time to start learning. I think you will find it easier using C# to learn it instead of doing managed code with C++. "}

You could keep much of your application the same, and make calls out to Python for the pieces that change often, or need the flexibility that a scripting language provides. From the Python docs The previous chapters discussed how to extend Python, that is, how to extend the functionality of Python by attaching a library of C functions to it. It is also possible to do it the other way around: enrich your C/C++ application by embedding Python in it. Embedding provides your application with the ability to implement some of the functionality of your application in Python rather than C or C++. This can be used for many purposes; one example would be to allow users to tailor the application to their needs by writing some scripts in Python. You can also use it yourself if some of the functionality can be written in Python more easily. "}

However, if you want to find a control in a form based on the form's reference, it's not enough to simply look at the form's control collection. Since every control have it's own control collection, you will have to recurse through them all to find a specific control.

I'm setting up a new hosting solution and would much prefer to run a 64bit OS, and since it's an ASP.Net MVC solution with SQL Server DB, the OS is either going to be Windows Server 2003 or (hopfully!) 2008. I know that this could spill over into a debate regarding 32bit vs 64bit on servers, but let's just say that my preference is 64bit and that I have some very good reasons. So far, I've tried a number of options and found a bit of help related to getting this up on a 32bit machine (and succeeded I might add), but since the original Windows port is Win32 specific, this is hardly going to help when installing as a service on x64. It also has a dependency on the libevent for which I can only get a Win32 compiled version. I suspect that simply loading all this up in C++ and hitting \"compile\" (for 64bit) wouldn't work, not least because of the intricate differences in 32 and 64bit architectures, but I'm wondering if anyone is workng on getting this off the ground? Unfortunately, my expertise lie in managed code (C#) only, otherwise I would try and take this on myself, but I can't believe I'm the only guy out there trying to get memcached running on a 64 bit Windows server....am I?? Any help or recommendations appreciated... Update Yes I'm afraid I'm still looking for an answer to this - all my efforts (with my pathetic C++ skills) to make a stable build have failed - I've trashed one server and 3 VM's just trying it out so now I turn to the real experts. Is anyone planning on porting this to 64bit? Or are you really suggesting that I use MS Velocity instead? I shudder at the thought... Update: @Lars - I do use Enyim actually - it's very good, but what you're referring to is a client, rather than the server part. @DannySmurf - I've only been able to install it as a service on a 32 bit OS. 64 bit OS rejects the installation of this Win32 service. Of course yes, lots of Win32 code works seamlessly on x64 architecture, hence you can run 32bit apps (like Office for instance) or games on Vista/XP 64 etc, but this doesn't translate directly when it comes to services. I'm no expert, I suspect that it has to do with the syncs or eventing that services need to subscribe to, and I suspect that 64 and 32 don't play nicely. I'm happy to be corrected on any of this, but to answer your question - yes I have tried. @OJ - thanks very much for the straight-forward response. I thought as much, but wasn't sure if anyone else had suggestions or had already gone down this route. Maybe when StackOverflow is LIVE, then more people will respond and let me know if this is something being looked into, and although I can try and compile it myself - I simply can't \"trust\" (with my C++ experience level) that it would provide \"Enterprise Level\" reliability in such a crucial component of large scalable solutions. I think it would need educated intervention rather than my unsanitised experimental approach before I could be confident. One little oversight on my part, could bring the site down.

I have a flash applet that needs to maintain a TCP connection to a server. I have implemented timeouts using Timers, a ping-pong system, etc. However, there's a problem. Upon calling Socket.connect(), the flash player (9.0.115 and many other stables before that) sends 3 connection requests by way of SYN packets, with some time in between. If none of those are replied to (e.g. because the server is down), I cannot get the applet to [attempt to] connect to the server. Ever. That is, within the lifetime of the applet. To clarify and/or summarize: For any host/port pair given to Socket.connect() or XMLSocket.connect(), if the call fails, any subsequent connect() calls to any other Socket (or XMLSocket) instances within the lifetime of the Flash applet to the same host/port pair get ignored. (At least as far as I can tell using a packet sniffer.) I have tried calling numerous Socket methods, destroying\u00b9 and recreating the objects, using a pool of Sockets, and various other methods I can't remember right now; all to no avail. My current solution is to notify the parent webpage through a JavaScript call and let it reload my applet. It's not a pretty solution, and I'm not about to implement workarounds for the problems it causes, just because Flash can't handle socket connections properly. I must be missing something very simple. Any ideas? 1: I know you can't really destroy objects; I just remove all references to them and hope for the best. I haven't tried to explicitly invoke the GC in this case. (Though I think I did try putting the Socket inside an Array and using delete.) Yes, it works as expected if the connection is successful (even if the connection drops later on.) The only event to trigger this is the case when the server doesn't respond at all; it's as if Flash marks the host/port combination as \"offline\" and doesn't bother sending any more packets to it for the lifetime of the applet. I suspect an active refusal of the connection (e.g. host is online but not listening to the port) doesn't cause this. I get no error message or feedback of any other kind from the Socket. Have you ever called connect() more than once to the same host/port pair, when the first one failed? How did you know the first connect() failed? And before subsequent connect() calls, did you do anything to reset the socket? "}

(bool, int, string, etc.) Now, I know you can limit the generic type parameter to a type or interface implementation via the where clause. However, this doesn't fit the bill for primitives (AFAIK) because they do not all have a common ground (apart from object before someone says! :P). So, my current thoughts are to just grit my teeth and do a big switch statement and throw an ArgumentException on failure.. EDIT 1: Just to clarify: The code definition should be like: public class MyClass<GenericType> .... And instantiation: MyClass<bool> = new MyClass<bool>(); // Legal MyClass<string> = new MyClass<string>(); // Legal MyClass<DataSet> = new MyClass<DataSet>(); // Illegal MyClass<RobsFunkyHat> = new MyClass<RobsFunkyHat>(); // Illegal (but looks awesome!) EDIT 2 @Jon Limjap - Good point, and something I was already considering.. I'm sure there is a generic method that can be used to determine if the type is of a value or reference type.. This could be useful in instantly removing a lot of the objects I dont want to deal with (but then you need to worry about the structs that are used such as Size ).. Interesting problem no? :) Here it is: where T : struct Taken from MSDN. I'm curious.. Could this be done in .NET 3.x using extension methods? Create an interface, and implement the interface in the extension methods (which would probably be cleaner than a bit fat switch). Plus if you then need to later extend to any lightweight custom types, they can also implement the same interface, with no changes required to the base code. What do you guys think? Sad news is I am working in Framework 2!! :D EDIT 3 This was so simple following on from Jon Limjaps Pointer.. So simple I almost want to cry, but it's great because the code works like a charm! So here is what I did (you'll laugh!): Code added to the generic class bool TypeValid() { // Get the TypeCode from the Primitive Type TypeCode code = Type.GetTypeCode(typeof(PrimitiveDataType)); // All of the TypeCode Enumeration refer Primitive Types // with the exception of Object and Empty (Null). // Since I am willing to allow Null Types (at this time) // all we need to check for is Object! switch (code) { case TypeCode.Object: return false; default: return true; } } Then a little utility method to check the type and throw an exception, private void EnforcePrimitiveType() { if (!TypeValid()) throw new InvalidOperationException( \"Unable to Instantiate SimpleMetadata based on the Generic Type of '\" + typeof(PrimitiveDataType).Name + \"' - this Class is Designed to Work with Primitive Data Types Only.\"); } All that then needs to be done is to call EnforcePrimitiveType() in the classes constructors. Job done! :-) The only one downside, it only throws an exception at runtime (obviously) rather than design time.. But that's no big deal and could be picked up with utilities like FxCop (which we don't use at work). Special thanks to Jon Limjap on this one! "}

I disagree wholeheartedly that PowerShell is not a dev's tool. As a .NET based product, it is a direct analogue to .NET programming. Whole .NET programs can be prototyped in PS, as well as little oneliners to test functionality of methods...etc. That the language architects for PS specifically designed PS's syntax to be close to C#, means there is very little context switch when writing PS scripts and C# code(something I had to do alot recently). You're building on your knowledge already hard won with .NET languages, using PS. As an automation tool, it is superb. It access's WMI, ADO, ADSI, .NET, COM natively, plus can be spot-welded to work with anything else. This alone makes any Windows automation easier and more powerful. The amount of access to the system is paralled by some other langauges (VBscript, Python) but the ease of use of the language and the benefit of the .NET framework means that some PS scripting is tying together existing code (code reuse) instead of wasting your time writing yet another file zipping routine (for example...) There are already projects out there that are making build tools (psake comes to mind) to make dev's life easier. Projects like Powershell Community Extensions show the powerful extension capabilities normal every-day devs can achieve. I agree with some of the posters above, I consider anything done to setup build envrionments or work with data for dev tasks, can be done with PS, if not faster/easier/better, but just as well.

You can do something like: SELECT col1, col2, col3, col4 FROM tbl and manually choose the columns you want. However, if you want a lot of columns, then you might just want to do a: SELECT * FROM tbl and just ignore what you don't want. In your particular case, I would suggest: SELECT * FROM tbl unless you only want a few columns. If you only want four columns, then: SELECT col3, col6, col45, col 52 FROM tbl would be fine, but if you want 50 columns, then any code that makes the query would become (too?) difficult to read. "}

They work in coordination with the System.TypedReference struct. There's also __arglist, which is used for variable length parameter lists. One thing folks don't know much about is System.WeakReference -- a very useful class that keeps track of an object but still allows the garbage collector to collect it. The most useful \"hidden\" feature would be the yield return keyword. It's not really hidden, but a lot of folks don't know about it.

Now it doesn't, but the compiler won't let me build the project without the assembly reference in place. Let me elaborate. This project used to throw and catch a custom exception class - the SuperException - which was derived from the standard System.Exception and lived in a separate, precompiled assembly, SuperAssembly.DLL, which I referenced. Eventually, I decided this was a pointless exercise and replaced all SuperExceptions with a System.SuitableStandardException in each case. I removed the reference to SuperException.DLL, but am now met with the following on trying to compile the project: The type 'SuperException' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced. You must add a reference to assembly 'SuperException, Version=1.1.0.0 (...)' The source file referenced by the error doesn't seem relevant; it's the project namespace that gets highlighted in the IDE. Now, here's the thing: All uses of SuperException have been eliminated from the project's code. Compared to another project that compiles fine without a reference to SuperException.DLL, I only reference one more assembly - and that references nothing that my project doesn't reference itself. While it's possible that any of these dependencies could throw SuperExceptions, I'm only catching the base Exception class and in any case... the other project builds fine!

We have two large files which we'd like to read from two separate threads concurrently. One thread will sequentially read fileA while the other thread will sequentially read fileB. There is no locking or communication between the threads, both are sequentially reading as fast as they can, and both are immediately discarding the data they read. Our experience with this setup on Windows is very poor. The combined throughput of the two threads is in the order of 2-3 MiB/sec. The drive seems to be spending most of its time seeking backwards and forwards between the two files, presumably reading very little after each seek. If we disable one of the threads and temporarily look at the performance of a single thread then we get much better bandwidth (~45 MiB/sec for this machine). So clearly the bad two-thread performance is an artefact of the OS disk scheduler. Is there anything we can do to improve the concurrent thread read performance? Perhaps by using different APIs or by tweaking the OS disk scheduler parameters in some way. Some details: The files are in the order of 2 GiB each on a machine with 2GiB of RAM. For the purpose of this question we consider them not to be cached and perfectly defragmented. We have used defrag tools and rebooted to ensure this is the case. We are using no special APIs to read these files. The behaviour is repeatable across various bog-standard APIs such as Win32's CreateFile, C's fopen, C++'s std::ifstream, Java's FileInputStream, etc. Each thread spins in a loop making calls to the read function. We have varied the number of bytes requested from the API each iteration from values between 1KiB up to 128MiB. Varying this has had no effect, so clearly the amount the OS is physically reading after each disk seek is not dictated by this number. This is exactly what should be expected. The dramatic difference between one-thread and two-thread performance is repeatable across Windows 2000, Windows XP (32-bit and 64-bit), Windows Server 2003, and also with and without hardware RAID5. "}
{"user":"755","questionId":"9191","creationDate":"2008-08-12T19:51:06.323","answerId":"9193","type":"answer","body":"I'd like to add some further notes in my response. All other non-Microsoft operating systems we have tested do not suffer from this problem. Linux, FreeBSD, and Mac OS X (this final one on different hardware) all degrade much more gracefully in terms of aggregate bandwidth when moving from one thread to two. Linux for example degraded from ~45 MiB/sec to ~42 MiB/sec. These other operating systems must be reading larger chunks of the file between each seek, and therefor not spending nearly all their time waiting on the disk to seek. Our solution for Windows is to pass the FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING flag to CreateFile and use large (~16MiB) reads in each call to ReadFile. This is suboptimal for several reasons: Files don't get cached when read like this, so there are none of the advantages that caching normally gives. The constraints when working with this flag are much more complicated than normal reading (alignment of read buffers to page boundaries, etc). (As a final remark. Does this explain why swapping under Windows is so hellish? Ie, Windows is incapable of doing IO to multiple files concurrently with any efficiency, so while swapping all other IO operations are forced to be disproportionately slow.) Edit to add some further details for Will Dean: Of course across these different hardware configurations the raw figures did change (sometimes substantially). The problem however is the consistent degradation in performance that only Windows suffers when moving from one thread to two. Here is a summary of the machines tested: Several Dell workstations (Intel Xeon) of various ages running Windows 2000, Windows XP (32-bit), and Windows XP (64-bit) with single drive. A Dell 1U server (Intel Xeon) running Windows Server 2003 (64-bit) with RAID 1+0. An HP workstation (AMD Opteron) with Windows XP (64-bit), and Windows Server 2003, and hardware RAID 5. My home unbranded PC (AMD Athlon64) running Windows XP (32-bit), FreeBSD (64-bit), and Linux (64-bit) with single drive. My home MacBook (Intel Core1) running Mac OS X, single SATA drive. My home Koolu PC running Linux. Vastly underpowered compared to the other systems but I demonstrated that even this machine can outperform a Windows server with RAID5 when doing multi-threaded disk reads. CPU usage on all of these systems was very low during the tests and anti-virus was disabled. I forgot to mention before but we also tried the normal Win32 CreateFile API with the FILE_FLAG_SEQUENTIAL_SCAN flag set. This flag didn't fix the problem. "}

It was such a huge pain that I ended up writing a Win32 frontend instead. From the top of my head, I encountered the following problems: Development of the ODBC link seems to have ceased long ago. There are various different versions floating around --- very confusing. The ODBC link doesn't support Unicode/UTF8, and I remember there were other issues with it as well (though some could be overcome by careful configuration). You probably want to manually tweak your db schema to make it compatible with MS Access. I see you already found out about the needed surrogate keys (i.e., int primary keys) :-) You should keep in mind that you may need to use pass-through queries to do more sophisticated SQL manipulations of the MySQL database. Be careful with using lots of VBA, as that tends to corrupt your frontend file. Regularly compressing the database (using main menu, Tools | Database utilities | Compress and restore, or something like that --- I'm using the Dutch version) and making lots of backups is necessary. Access tends to cause lots of network traffic. Like, really huge lots. I haven't been able to find a solution for that. Using a network monitor is recommended if you want to keep an eye on that! Access insists on storing booleans as 0/-1. IMHO, 0/+1 makes more sense, and I believe it is the default way of doing things in MySQL as well. Not a huge problem, but if your checkboxes don't work, you should definitely check this. One possible alternative would be to put the backend (with the data) on a shared drive. I remember this is well-documented, also in the help. You may want to have a look at some general advice on splitting into a frontend and a backend and code that automatically reconnects to the backend on startup; I can also send you some more sample code, or post it here. Otherwise, you might also want to consider MS SQL. I don't have experience with that, but I presume it works together with MS Access much more nicely! "}

In my experience, there are two key things that can help keep your personal server secure enough to throw up on the internet while retaining your sanity: 1) Security through obscurity Needless to say, relying on this in the 'real world' is a bad idea and not to be entertained. But that's because in the real world, baddies know what's there and that there's loot to be had. On a personal server, the majority of 'attacks' you'll suffer will simply be automated sweeps from machines that have already been compromised, looking for default installations of products known to be vulnerable. If your server doesn't offer up anything enticing on the default ports or in the default locations, the automated attacker will move on. Therefore, if you're going to run a ssh server, put it on a non-standard port (>1024) and it's likely it will never be found. If you can get away with this technique for your web server then great, shift that to an obscure port too. 2) Package management Don't compile and install Apache or sshd from source yourself unless you absolutely have to. If you do, you're taking on the responsibility of keeping up-to-date with the latest security patches. Let the nice package maintainers from Linux distros such as Debian or Ubuntu do the work for you. Install from the distro's precompiled packages, and staying current becomes a matter of issuing the occasional apt-get update && apt-get -u dist-upgrade command, or using whatever fancy GUI tool Ubuntu provides.

In your business logic layer you have described your business objects: getters, setters, accessors, and so on... you get the idea. The interface to the business logic layer guarantees safe usage of the business logic, so all the methods and accessors you call will validate input. This great when you first write the UI code, because you have a neatly defined interface that you can trust. But here comes the tricky part, when you start writing the data access layer, the interface to the business logic does not accommodate your needs. You need to have more accessors and getters to set fields which are/used to be hidden. Now you are forced to erode the interface of your business logic; now it is possible set fields from the UI layer, which the UI layer has no business setting. Because of the changes needed for the data access layer, the interface to the business logic has eroded to the point where it is possible to even set the business logic with invalid data. Thus, the interface does not guarantee safe usage anymore. I hope I explained the problem clearly enough. How do you prevent interface eroding, maintain information hiding and encapsulation, and yet still accommodate different interface needs among different layers? "}

If I'm understanding your problem correctly, it sounds like you're trying to satisfy too much with a single interface, and that's just causing it to become cluttered. Why not have two interfaces into the business layer? One would be a simple, safe interface for the UI layer. The other would be a lower-level interface for the data layer.

The easiest way is to run a command to find all files under your clients root, and then attempt to add them to the depot. You'll end up with a changelist of all new files and existing files are ignored. E.g dir /s /b /A-D | p4 -x - add (use 'find . -type f -print' from a nix command line). If you want a physical list (in the console or file) then you can pipe on the results of a diff (or add if you also want them in a changelist). If you're running this within P4Win you can use $r to substitute the client root of the current workspace. "}

I basically just need a tool that works in OSX or Linux and keeps a remote directory in sync (mirrored) with a local directory while I make changes to the local directory. Update Looking through the solutions, I see a couple which solve the general problem of keeping a remote directory in sync with a local directory manually. I know that I can set a cron task to run rsync every minute, and this should be fairly close to real time. This is not the exact solution I was looking for as winscp does this and more: it detects file changes in a directory (while I work on them) and then automatically pushes the changes to the remote server. I know this is not the best solution (no code repository), but it allows me to very quickly test code on a server while I develop it.

This way the server and storage is off-site, but after the initial cost of the hardware, you are only paying for bandwidth. Granted, the downside to this is that, unlike something like S3, if the hardware goes down you have to go fix it yourself, or pay the CoLo people to.

With 2014 knowledge, I can truly say that auto-properties are among the best things that ever happened to the C# language. I am used to create my properties in C# using a private and a public field: private string title; public string Title { get { return title; } set { title = value; } } Now, with .NET 3.0, we got auto-properties: public string Title { get; set; } I know this is more a philosophical/subjective questions, but is there any reason to use these auto-properties except from saving five lines of code for each field? My personal gripe is that those properties are hiding stuff from me, and I am not a big fan of black magic. In fact, the hidden private field does not even show up in the debugger, which is OK given the fact that the get/set functions do nothing. But when I want to actually implement some getter/setter logic, I have to use the private/public pair anyway. I see the benefit that I save a lot of code (one vs six lines) without losing the ability to change the getter/setter logic later, but then again I can already do that by simply declaring a public field \"Public string Title\" without the need of the { get; set; } block, thus even saving more code.

I also have code in the OnPreRender method that will enable or disable the second drop-down based on the value of the first drop-down. This is so that the value of the first drop-down can be selected in code (loading user settings). My problem is: The user selects something in the first drop-down. The second drop-down will become enabled through javascript. They then change a third drop-down that initiates a post back. After the post back the drop-downs are in the correct state (first value selected, second drop-down enabled). If they then click the back button, the second drop-down will no longer be enabled although it should be since there's something selected in the first drop-down. I've tried adding a startup script (that will set the correct state of the second-drop down) through ClientScript.RegisterStartupScript, however when this gets called the first drop-down has a selectedIndex of 0, not what it actually is. My guess is that the value of the selection gets set after my start script (but still doesn't call the onChange script). Any ideas on what to try? "}

The following function (print) is an example of a function which could be passed to func as a parameter because it is the proper type: void print ( int x ) { printf(\"%d\\n\", x); } Function Call When calling a function with a function parameter, the value passed must be a pointer to a function. Use the function's name (without parentheses) for this: func(print); would call func, passing the print function to it. Function Body As with any parameter, func can now use the parameter's name in the function body to access the value of the parameter. Let's say that func will apply the function it is passed to the numbers 0-4. Consider, first, what the loop would look like to call print directly: for ( int ctr = 0 ; ctr < 5 ; ctr++ ) { print(ctr); } Since func's parameter declaration says that f is the name for a pointer to the desired function, we recall first that if f is a pointer then *f is the thing that f points to (i.e. the function print in this case). As a result, just replace every occurrence of print in the loop above with *f: void func ( void (*f)(int) ) { for ( int ctr = 0 ; ctr < 5 ; ctr++ ) { (*f)(ctr); } } From http://math.hws.edu/bridgeman/courses/331/f05/handouts/c-c++-notes.html "}

This may not be an easy task depending on the code. If it was written with 64-bit portability in mind then it could be a simple recompile. If it hasn't, then you could well be up for quite a bit of patching before getting it to build.. and then you'd have to verify that you haven't broken anything! I don't think you're overestimating the differences between 32 and 64-bit at all. A common mistake is to assume that the job is a simple recompile when in fact it isn't. There are more portability issues than most people realise. Just because the application builds and you end up with a binary, it doesn't mean that the binary is going to behave as it should. Especially when it may interact with other 32-bit code. Having said that, it might be worth giving it a spin! Good luck. Cheers! @Lars: I recommend reading the question before attempting an answer. @John Sibly & @DannySmurf: given the nature of Memcached and what it aims to achieve, surely you wouldn't want to run a 32-bit version on a 64-bit machine?

To avoid this unpleasantness I would recommend that you typedef the function pointer into something more readable. For example. typedef void (*functiontype)(); Declares a function that returns void and takes no arguments. To create a function pointer to this type you can now do: void dosomething() { } functiontype func = &dosomething; func(); For a function that returns an int and takes a char you would do typedef int (*functiontype2)(char); and to use it int dosomethingwithchar(char a) { return 1; } functiontype2 func2 = &dosomethingwithchar int result = func2('a'); There are libraries that can help with turning function pointers into nice readable types.

While WAP got a lot of bad press, it's strength is where you have low bandwidth high-latency connections. The WML content gets optimised by the carrier's gateway to greatly reduce the amount of data transmitted over the air. If you have iPhones and the like, in areas with solid 3G coverage you can afford to go for richer content, but if you want an app to still perform well in more out of the way areas, WAP has a big advantage. One thing to watch out for with WAP is that the quality of the WAP support in handsets varies a lot (guess you'd also say the same for smartphone web browsers). Most of them display pages ok, but the form handling is truly awful in some browsers. If you vary content based on user-agent, you should also provide an explicit way to access a specific type of content (e.g. seperate uri's) - the automated choice is not always right and you want the client to be able to override it .

Rather than subject users to the hangs, we've rolled back to the previous release while we determine a solution. The first step is to reproduce the problem -- but we can't. Here's some background: Prod has a single virtualized (vmware) web server with two CPUs and 2 GB of RAM. The database server has 4GB, and 2 CPUs as well. It's also on VMWare, but separate physical hardware. During normal usage the application runs fine. The w3wp.exe process normally uses betwen 5-20% CPU and around 200MB of RAM. CPU and RAM fluctuate slightly under normal use, but nothing unusual. However, when we start running into problems, the RAM climbs dramatically and the CPU pegs at 98% (or as much as it can get). The site becomes unresponsive, necessitating a IIS restart. Resetting the app pool does nothing in this situation, a full IIS restart is required. It does not happen during the night (no usage). It happens more when the site is under load, but it has also happened under non-peak periods. First step to solving this problem is reproducing it. To simulate the load, we starting using JMeter to simulate usage. Our load script is based on actual usage around the time of the crash. Using JMeter, we can ramp the usage up quite high (2-3 times the load during the crash) but the site behaves fine. CPU is up high, and the site does become sluggish, but memory usage is reasonable and nothing is hanging. Does anyone have any tips on how to reproduce a problem like this in a non-production environment? We'd really like to reproduce the error, determine a solution, then test again to make sure we've resolved it. During the process we've found a number of small things that we've improved that might solve the problem, but I'd really feel a lot more confident if we could reproduce the problem and test the improved version.

{"user":"1131","questionId":"9240","creationDate":"2008-08-13T06:08:24.597","answerId":"9502","type":"answer","body":"If I understand the question correctly, you've created a domain model and you would like to write an object-relational mapper to map between records in your database and your domain objects. However, you're concerned about polluting your domain model with the 'plumbing' code that would be necessary to read and write to your object's fields. Taking a step back, you essentially have two choices of where to put your data mapping code - within the domain class itself or in an external mapping class. The first option is often called the Active Record pattern and has the advantage that each object knows how to persist itself and has sufficient access to its internal structure to allow it to perform the mapping without needing to expose non-business related fields. E.g public class User { private string name; private AccountStatus status; private User() { } public string Name { get { return name; } set { name = value; } } public AccountStatus Status { get { return status; } } public void Activate() { status = AccountStatus.Active; } public void Suspend() { status = AccountStatus.Suspended; } public static User GetById(int id) { User fetchedUser = new User(); // Lots of database and error-checking code // omitted for clarity // ... fetchedUser.name = (string) reader[\"Name\"]; fetchedUser.status = (int)reader[\"statusCode\"] == 0 ? AccountStatus.Suspended : AccountStatus.Active; return fetchedUser; } public static void Save(User user) { // Code to save User's internal structure to database // ... } } In this example, we have an object that represents a User with a Name and an AccountStatus. We don't want to allow the Status to be set directly, perhaps because we want to check that the change is a valid status transition, so we don't have a setter. Fortunately, the mapping code in the GetById and Save static methods have full access to the object's name and status fields. The second option is to have a second class that is responsible for the mapping. This has the advantage of seperating out the different concerns of business logic and persistence which can allow your design to be more testable and flexible. The challenge with this method is how to expose the name and status fields to the external class. Some options are: 1. Use reflection (which has no qualms about digging deep into your object's private parts) 2. Provide specially-named, public setters (e.g. prefix them with the word 'Private') and hope no one uses them accidentally 3. If your language suports it, make the setters internal but grant your data mapper module access. E.g. use the InternalsVisibleToAttribute in .NET 2.0 onwards or friend functions in C++ For more information, I'd recommend Martin Fowler's classic book 'Patterns of Enterprise Architecture' However, as a word of warning, before going down the path of writing your own mappers I'd strongly recommend looking at using a 3rd-party object relational mapper (ORM) tool such as nHibernate or Microsoft's Entity Framework. I've worked on four different projects where, for various reasons, we wrote our own mapper and it is very easy to waste a lot of time maintaining and extending the mapper instead of writing code that provides end user value. I've used nHibernate on one project so far and, although it has quite a steep learning curve initially, the investment you put in early on pays off considerably. "}

This isn't really immutable as you can still access the private setter through reflection. As of C#6 you can also create true readonly properties - i.e. immutable properties that cannot be changed outside of the constructor: public string PropertyName { get; } public MyClass() { this.PropertyName = \"whatever\"; } At compile time that will become: readonly string pName; public string PropertyName { get { return this.pName; } } public MyClass() { this.pName = \"whatever\"; } In immutable classes with a lot of members this saves a lot of excess code.

Once you have covered the fundamentals of Python then you should sit back and let him experiement with the language. In one of my University subjects for this semester they have taken an approach called Problem Based Learning(PBL) in which they use lectures to stimulate students about different approaches to problems. Since your brother is keen you should take a similiar approach. Set him small projects to work on and let him figure it out for himself. Then once he is finished you can go through his approach and compare and contrast with different methods. If you can give him just the right amount of help to steer him in the right direction then he should be fine. Providng him with some good websites and books would also be a good idea. I'd also recommend sticking away from IDE's at the starting stages.

There is a W3C recommendation for SVG though this format is still not recognized by Internet Explorer support of which is a must (for a public website). IE handles VML though and there are even javascript libraries that do some canvas-like drawing depending on a browser (SVG vs. VML) - excanvas, GFX of Dojo Toolkit and more. That would be nice and acceptable though none of them can display an SVG image from the given markup. So the question actually consists of several parts: Are there any cross-browser Javascript libraries that display vector graphics from given markup (not obligatory SVG) and offer availability to attach to DOM events? If there are not, which of the most pupular browser-embedded technologies would be most suitable for doing such a task? I can choose from Flex/Flash, Java applet. Silverlight is not an option because of Windows lock-in. [EDIT] Thank you all for your comments/suggestions. Below are just some my random notes/conclusions on this matter: The level of interactivity I need is ability to detect DOM events on the vector image being displayed - mouseover, mouseout, click etc. - and ability to react on them like changing background color, displaying dialog etc. The idea of sticking with SVG format is quite well as it is native on many browsers except the most popular one - IE. After some experimenting with displaying dynamic SVG I realized that IE version 7 the most problematic. There's too much hassle because of browser incompatibilities. Cake seems a great Javascript framework, though I could not get the examples working on IE7. Java Applets - I liked that idea the most as I though I could use the Apache Batik library, a quality SVG renderer. However, Batik is very big library and I cannot afford deploying an applet that weights few megabytes. I decided to stick with the Flex option. I found a nice vector graphics library Degrafa. It uses its own markup format however it recognizes SVG path notation, so in my case it is going to be quite easy to transform my SVGs using XSLT or just parsing them. [EDIT 2] Some more comments appeared. I'd like to clarify that by \"Windows lock-in\" I mean the situation that Silverlight would normally run on Windows, more specifically, IE. I doubt it is an accepted solution (like Flash or Java Applet, for instance) on other systems. Yes, I have no doubt that one is able to launch Silverlight app on any system though I fear it would be too much effort for an average user. @Akira: Have you had any problems with those \"SVG renderers\" on IE7?

Currently, if two users open the same document, then modify it and save the changes, the document's state will be undefined (either the first user's changes are saved permanently, or the second's). This is entirely unsatisfactory. I considered two possibilities to solve this problem: The first is to lock the document when it is opened by someone the first time, and unlock it when it is closed. But if the network connection to the server is suddenly interrupted, the document would stay in a forever-locked state. The obvious solution is to send regular pings to the server. If the server doesn't receive K pings in a row (K > 1) from a particular client, documents locked by this client are unlocked. If that client re-appears, documents are locked again, if someone hadn't already locked them. This could also help if the client application (running in web browser) is terminated unexpectedly, making it impossible to send a 'quitting, unlock my documents' signal to the server. The second is to store multiple versions of the same document saved by different users. If changes to the document are made in rapid succession, the system would offer either to merge versions or to select a preferred version. To optimize storage space, only document diffs should be kept (just like source control software). What method should I choose, taking into consideration that the connection to the server might sometimes be slow and unresponsive? How should the parameters (ping interval, rapid succession interval) be determined? P.S. Unfortunately, I can't store the documents in a database. "}

Any field can be searched at anytime and in combination with one or more other fields. The actual sql query gets created dynamically depending on which fields are searched.

When the first user (Bob) opens the document, he acquires a lock so that other users can only read the current document. If the user saves the document while he is using it, he keeps the lock. Only when he exits the document, it is unlocked and other people can edit it. If the second user (Kate) opens the document while Bob has the lock on it, Kate will get a message saying the document is uneditable but she can read it until it the lock has been released. So what happens when Bob acquires the lock, maybe saves the document once or twice but then exits the application leaving the lock hanging? As you said yourself, requiring the client with the lock to send pings at a certain frequency is probably the best option. If you don't get a ping from the client for a set amount of time, this effectively means his client is not responding anymore. If this is a web application you can use javascript for the pings. The document that was last saved releases its lock and Kate can now acquire it. A ping can contain the name of the document that the client has a lock on, and the server can calculate when the last ping for that document was received. "}

A point which has been brought up recurrently, is that of dealing with system vs. user values; in our project user and system vals are stored together. For example... We have a list of templates. 1, <system template> 2, <system template> 3, <system template> These are mapped in the app to an enum (1, 2, 3) Then a user comes in and adds... 4, <user template> ...and... 5, <user template> Then.. we issue an upgrade.. and insert as part of our upgrade scripts... <new id> [6], <new system template> THEN!!... we find a bug in the new system template and need to update it... The problem is how? We cannot update record using ID6 (as we may have inserted it as 9, or 999, so we have to identify the record using some other mechanism) So, we've come to two possible solutions for this. In the red corner (speed).... We simply start user Ids at 5000 (or some other value) and test data at 10000 (or some other value). This would allow us to make modifications to system values and test them up to the lower limit of the next ID range. Advantage...Quick and easy to implement, Disadvantage... could run out of values if we don't choose a big enough range! In the blue corner (scalability)... We store, system and user data separately, use GUIDs as Ids and merge the two lists using a view. Advantage...Scalable..No limits w/regard to DB size. Disadvantage.. More complicated to implement.

In particular, double and long (Int64 and UInt64) are not guaranteed to be atomic on a 32-bit platform. You can use the methods on the Interlocked class to protect these. Additionally, while reads and writes are atomic, there is a race condition with addition, subtraction, and incrementing and decrementing primitive types, since they must be read, operated on, and rewritten. The interlocked class allows you to protect these using the CompareExchange and Increment methods. Interlocking creates a memory barrier to prevent the processor from reordering reads and writes. The lock creates the only required barrier in this example. "}

What happens if a document is locked and someone goes on holiday with their client connected?

(If the same section is modified regularly then performing a merge may take longer than simply making the changes again).

According to what I found here there are many ways for an O.S. to schedule disk requests. While Linux and others can choose between different policies, before Vista Windows was locked in a single policy: a FIFO queue, where all requests where splitted in 64 KB blocks. I believe that this policy is the cause for the problem you are experiencing: the scheduler will mix requests from the two threads, causing continuous seek between different areas of the disk. Now, the good news is that according to here and here, Vista introduced a smarter disk scheduler, where you can set the priority of your requests and also allocate a minimum badwidth for your process. The bad news is that I found no way to change disk policy or buffers size in previous versions of Windows. Also, even if raising disk I/O priority of your process will boost the performance against the other processes, you still have the problems of your threads competing against each other. What I can suggest is to modify your software by introducing a self-made disk access policy. For example, you could use a policy like this in your thread B (similar for Thread A): if THREAD A is reading from disk then wait for THREAD A to stop reading or wait for X ms Read for X ms (or Y MB) Stop reading and check status of thread A again You could use semaphores for status checking or you could use perfmon counters to get the status of the actual disk queue. The values of X and/or Y could also be auto-tuned by checking the actual trasfer rates and slowly modify them, thus maximizing the throughtput when the application runs on different machines and/or O.S. You could find that cache, memory or RAID levels affect them in a way or the other, but with auto-tuning you will always get the best performance in every scenario. "}

So, the inconvenience introduced by locks is minimized. People mostly extend existing documents and correct mistakes in them. Speaking about the pessimistic model, the 'left client connected for N days' scenario could be avoided by setting lock expire date to, say, one day before lock start date. Because documents edited are by no means mission critical, and are modified by multiple users quite rarely, that could be enough. Now consider the optimistic model. How should the differences be detected, if the documents have some regular (say, hierarchical) structure? If not? What are the chances of successful automatic merge in these cases? The situation becomes more complicated, because some of the documents (edited by the 'admins' user group) contain important configuration information (document global index, user roles, etc.). To my mind, locks are more advantageous for precisely this kind of information, because it's not changed on everyday basis. So some hybrid solution might be acceptable. What do you think? "}

I think it would be more correct to say that it's probably worthwhile writing your backend code in C++, regardless of the performance implications. Even though you can't tie your higher-ups down on the platform switch, it would be prudent of you to make preparations for that eventuality, since management types tend to change their mind alot without good reason (or warning); even if they decide not to switch now, that doesn't mean that they won't decide to switch six months from now. Writing your logic in C++ now, knowing that it's a possibility, though more difficult, may make your life significantly easier later. 2) Not really. There are \"solutions\" like wxWindows and GTK#, but often they're buggy, or difficult to get working properly, or they lack something important on one platform or another. They also usually lock you into a lowest-common-denominator UI (ie, general controls work fine but you can forget about ever doing something interesting -- WPF, for example -- with it).

For example, passing in \"brian\" for @name and null for @nick results in the following query being evaluated: SELECT Name, Nickname FROM Users WHERE Name = 'brian' AND Nickname = Nickname The coalesce operator turns the null into an identity evaluation, which is always true and doesn't affect the where clause.

I'd be willing to bet that this will be the best advert for your skills because: It's always updated (if you post often) It's not like you're looking for work doing it - but your (future) employer, or their developers will check it out anyway to get a better insight into your character. Putting something on your resume doesn't mean you can do it. I'm not saying that you'd lie about your skills :-), but there's no argument about your ability when you're writing articles about the stuff, getting comments and feedback, and better yet, learning EVEN MORE about your passions. Best of all - you can run your blog from your chosen domain and also point to your resume that is stored in linkedIn. Just an idea... That's my two pennys worth on that - hope it helps you come to a decision! "}

Programming WPF - Chris Sells & Ian Griffiths Another great book - I wish this was available when I was first learning the framework. Application = Code + Markup - Charles Petzold This was the very first WPF I purchased. It is not very newbie friendly, and I wouldn't recommend it for a first-time-wpf'er. The fact that Xaml is not introduced until page 457 makes learning the technology for the real world very difficult.

Assuming strict mode (the default compiler mode) it is not possible to modify the prototype of non-dynamic class types in ActionScript 3. I'm not even sure that it's possible in non-strict mode. Is wrapping an option? Basically you create a class that takes one of the objects you get from the web service and just forwards all method calls to that, but also has methods of its own: public class FooWrapper extends Foo { private var wrappedFoo : Foo; public function FooWrapper( foo : Foo ) { wrappedFoo = foo; } override public function methodFromFoo( ) : void { wrappedFoo.methodFromFoo(); } override public function anotherMethodFromFoo( ) : void { wrappedFoo.anotherMethodFromFoo(); } public function newMethodNotOnFoo( ) : String { return \"Hello world!\" } } When you want to work with a Foo, but also have the extra method you need you wrap the Foo instance in a FooWrapper and work with that object instead. It's not the most convenient solution, there's a lot of typing and if the generated code changes you have to change the FooWrapper class by hand, but unless you can modify the generated code either to include the method you want or to make the class dynamic I don't see how it can be done. Another solution is to add a step to your build process that modifies the source of the generated classes. I assume that you already have a step that generates the code from a WSDL, so what you could do is to add a step after that that inserts the methods you need. "}

You should have a dev database that everybody uses for daily dev tasks. Then a staging database that mimics production and is used to do your integration testing.

Here is what you see if you sniff the connection with Sql Profiler: -- network protocol: TCP/IP set quoted_identifier off set arithabort off set numeric_roundabort off set ansi_warnings on set ansi_padding on set ansi_nulls off set concat_null_yields_null on set cursor_close_on_commit off set implicit_transactions off set language us_english set dateformat mdy set datefirst 7 set transaction isolation level read committed I am now pasting those setting in above every query that I run when logged in to sql server, to make sure the settings are the same. For this case, I tried each setting individually, after disconnecting and reconnecting, and found that changing arithabort from off to on reduced the problem query from 90 seconds to 1 second. The most probable explanation is related to parameter sniffing, which is a technique Sql Server uses to pick what it thinks is the most effective query plan. When you change one of the connection settings, the query optimizer might choose a different plan, and in this case, it apparently chose a bad one. But I'm not totally convinced of this. I have tried comparing the actual query plans after changing this setting and I have yet to see the diff show any changes. Is there something else about the arithabort setting that might cause a query to run slowly in some cases? The solution seemed simple: Just put set arithabort on into the top of the stored procedure. But this could lead to the opposite problem: change the query parameters and suddenly it runs faster with 'off' than 'on'. For the time being I am running the procedure 'with recompile' to make sure the plan gets regenerated each time. It's Ok for this particular report, since it takes maybe a second to recompile, and this isn't too noticeable on a report that takes 1-10 seconds to return (it's a monster).

The request does have the \"Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\" - Is there any way have the WCF service gzip (or otherwise compress) the response? I did find this link but it sure seems a bit complex for functionality that should be handled out-of-the-box IMHO. OK - at first I marked the solution using the System.IO.Compression as the answer as I could never \"seem\" to get the IIS7 dynamic compression to work. Well, as it turns out: Dynamic Compression on IIS7 was working al along. It is just that Nikhil's Web Developer Helper plugin for IE did not show it working. My guess is that since SL hands the web service call off to the browser, that the browser handles it \"under the covers\" and Nikhil's tool never sees the compressed response. I was able to confirm this by using Fiddler which monitors traffic external to the browser application. In fiddler, the response was, in fact, gzip compressed!! The other problem with the System.IO.Compression solution is that System.IO.Compression does not exist in the Silverlight CLR. So from my perspective, the EASIEST way to enable WCF compression in Silverlight is to enable Dynamic Compression in IIS7 and write no code at all. "}

A classic source of bugs is when you shift a literal to, say, mask off bits. For example, if you wanted to drop the left-most bit of an unsigned integer, then you might try this as your mask: ~0 >> 1 Unfortunately, this will get you into trouble because the mask will have all of its bits set because the value being shifted (~0) is signed, thus an arithmetic shift is performed.

In addition, reads and writes of enum types with an underlying type in the previous list are also atomic. Reads and writes of other types, including long, ulong, double, and decimal, as well as user-defined types, are not guaranteed to be atomic. The code in my example was paraphrased from the Membership class, as written by the ASP.NET team themselves, so it was always safe to assume that the way it accesses the s_Initialized field is correct. Now we know why. Edit: As Thomas Danecker points out, even though the access of the field is atomic, s_Initialized should really be marked volatile to make sure that the locking isn't broken by the processor reordering the reads and writes.

Task automation -> Lee Holmes (a developer on the PowerShell team) posted a proof-of-concept called BgShell, which was basically the PowerShell runtime hosted in a windows forms app that listened for keystrokes and kicked off actions written in PowerShell based on them. It also included some clipboard automation. Quick access to the .NET framework. You don't have to compile and run something or use another program like Snippet Compiler to test some functionality. Load the assembly into your PowerShell session and interact with it. You get all the discoverability of PowerShell (like Get-Member) to explore your object. Easy to build domain specific languages. James Kovacs wrote a simple build script language with PowerShell called Psake. It can provide a scripting language for your application. Since PowerShell is part of the 09 Common Engineering Criteria, a lot of Microsoft applications will have interfaces for PowerShell, and familiarity with the language syntax will grow. You can leverage that knowledge by embedding the PowerShell runtime in your application and providing a scripting interface to your users, choosing what objects they will have access to. Along the same line, if you need to create a command-line interface for your application, PowerShell provides a large part of the underlying plumbing needed for parsing arguments, and other basic tasks, leaving only the business logic for you to write, and providing a consistent interface with other applications (for example, if you have user accounts that need to be managed (that don't already integrate with Active Directory, an admin could (using the Quest AD Cmdlets and your applications interface) Get-QADUser | New-MyApplicationUser and be done. The Exchange 2007 team did this very well. All the functionality is based on PowerShell cmdlets, the GUI calls the cmdlets and shows the user what is being run, so they can build scripts based off of that. It's just cool! In about 250 lines (including comments), Rob Foust and Jeff Hicks wrote a network sniffer in PowerShell. Easier to use than WinDump for lightweight troubleshooting.

I haven't used it for very long, but have been using it more and more (I like it a lot). Also I'm comfortable with lisp, but not super familiar with elisp. What I need to do is bind a regular expression to a keyboard combination because I use this particular regex so often. What I've been doing: M-C-s ^.*Table\\(\\(.*\\n\\)*?GO\\) Note, I used newline above, but I've found that for isearch-forward-regexp, you really need to replace the \\n in the regular expression with the result of C-q Q-j. This inserts a literal newline (without ending the command) enabling me to put a newline into the expression and match across lines. How can I bind this to a key combination? I vaguely understand that I need to create an elisp function which executes isearch-forward-regexp with the expression, but I'm fuzzy on the details. I've searched google and found most documentation to be a tad confusing. How can I bind a regular expression to a key combination in emacs? Mike Stone had the best answer so far -- not exactly what I was looking for but it worked for what I needed Edit - this sort of worked, but after storing the macro, when I went back to use it later, I couldn't use it with C-x e. (i.e., if I reboot emacs and then type M-x macro-name, and then C-x e, I get a message in the minibuffer like 'no last kbd macro' or something similar) @Mike Stone - Thanks for the information. I tried creating a macro like so: C-x( M-C-s ^.*Table\\(\\(.*C-q C-J\\)*?GO\\) C-x) This created my macro, but when I executed my macro I didn't get the same highlighting that I ordinarily get when I use isearch-forward-regexp. Instead it just jumped to the end of the next match of the expression. So that doesn't really work for what I need. Any ideas? Edit: It looks like I can use macros to do what I want, I just have to think outside the box of isearch-forward-regexp. I'll try what you suggested. "}

If record processing is reasonably long-running, the difference will be negligible, so the simpler approach (1 record per thread) is probably the best. 2. How many threads are you planning on starting? If you aren't using a threadpool, I think you either need to manually limit the number of threads, or you need to break the data into big chunks.

Look at which state is being protected by locks and then determine which state is under the protection of several locks. This will give you a sense of potential conflicts. Look at situations where code that holds a lock calls out to methods (don't forget virtual methods). Try to eliminate these calls where possible (by reducing the time the lock is held). Given the list of mutexes that are held and a rough idea of the state that they protect, assign a locking order (i.e., mutex A should always be taken before mutex B). Try to enforce this in the code. See if you can combine several locks into one if concurrency won't be adversely affected. For example, if mutex A and B seem like they might have deadlocks and an ordering scheme is not easily done, combine them to one lock initially. It's not going to be easy but I'm for simplifying the code at the expense of concurrency to get a handle of the problem. "}

As others have commented this situation is not unique to UI code, but is particularly common. In other languages such as C++ you are free to try and do this (without an exception being thrown as in WinForms), but your application may freeze and stop responding should a deadlock occur. Incidentally, you can easily tell the UI thread that you want to update a control, just create a delegate, then call the (asynchronous) BeginInvoke method on that control passing it your delegate.

You can't assume that your program is the only one running. When everyone is greedy with resources, the problem multiplies. I prefer to create my threads manually and control them myself. It keeps the code very easy to understand. That's fine when it's appropriate. If you need a bunch of worker threads, though, all you've done is make your code more complicated. Now you have to write code to manage them. If you just used a thread pool, you'd get all the thread management for free. And the thread pool provided by the language is very likely to be more robust, more efficient, and less buggy than whatever you roll for yourself. Thread t = new Thread(new ThreadStart(DoSomething)); t.Start(); t.Join(); I hope that you would normally have some additional code in between Start() and Join(). Otherwise, the extra thread is useless, and you're wasting resources for no reason. People are way too afraid of the resources used by threads. I've never seen creating and starting a thread to take more than a millisecond. There is no hard limit on the number of threads you can create. RAM usage is minimal. Once you have a few hundred threads, CPU becomes an issue because of context switches, so at that point you might want to get fancy with your design. A millisecond is a long time on modern hardware. That's 3 million cycles on a 3GHz machine. And again, you aren't the only one creating threads. Your threads compete for the CPU along with every other program's threads. If you use not-quite-too-many threads, and so does another program, then together you've used too many threads. Seriously, don't make life more complex than it needs to be. Don't use the thread pool unless you need something very specific that it offers. Indeed. Don't make life more complex. If your program needs multiple worker threads, don't reinvent the wheel. Use the thread pool. That's why it's there. Would you roll your own string class? "}
{"user":"543","questionId":"2364","creationDate":"2008-08-13T21:10:02.327","answerId":"10377","type":"answer","body":"First thing I think that I think is important is what bcwood said - understand the difference between a Unit Test and an Integration test. Integration tests are valuable, but typically are harder to write (and change) and run slower than Unit tests. Unit tests should be in total isolation and run quickly. I have a Java web app, written in Spring, that has about 1,000 Unit tests. It takes less than 10 seconds to run. Next it depends on what kind of application you're testing. If it's something new, you're in luck because you can use the latest and greatest framework that was made with testing in mind. for example, if you're doing a Java web app, go with Spring MVC. Better yet, go with Spring MVC with 2.5 annotations. Even more test-friendly. Instead of listing the \"pros\" of Unit testing (they are very well documented elsewhere) here are some of the cons, in my personal experience: if you're using a legacy app it might be hard to shoehorn testing in there It's hard to get everybody on the team on the same page with testing. some don't see the value, some are lazy, and some just don't get it if you thought selling the developers on it was hard, try selling it on the business people who aren't developers but still need to make technology decisions. I don't care how good the team is, there is going to be some ramp-up time for unit testing and the business people may not want to pay for it. a lot of teams decide to do integration testing to start, somehow thinking it is more valuable. it's not, I don't think it's less valuable but it's certainly not more valuable. as I said earlier, integration tests are slower to run and harder to write, and in my mind can be very frustrating to somebody new to writing tests. Start with REAL Unit testing, get the hand of it, and then move on to integration tests. In my experience having an automated build that does unit testing can be a productivity killer. maybe we just weren't doing it correctly, but what would happen is that several times a day automated tests would be run. if one failed, everybody on the team would receive an email notification. so now it's Office Space where 10 different people are telling you to fix a bug. there's probably a better way to handle this, but in my experience it wasn't very valuable.

If you don't know exactly what's running on your machine and exactly how many total threads, handles, CPU time, RAM, etc, that your app will use under a certain amount of load, you are in trouble. Are you the only target customer for the programs you write? If not, you can't be certain about most of that. You generally have no idea when you write a program whether it will execute effectively solo, or if it will run on a webserver being hammered by a DDOS attack. You can't know how much CPU time you are going to have. Assuming your program's behavior changes based on input, it's rare to even know exactly how much memory or CPU time your program will consume. Sure, you should have a pretty good idea about how your program is going to behave, but most programs are never analyzed to determine exactly how much memory, how many handles, etc. will be used, because a full analysis is expensive. If you aren't writing real-time software, the payoff isn't worth the effort. In general, claiming to know exactly how your program will behave is far-fetched, and claiming to know everything about the machine approaches ludicrous. And to be honest, if you don't know exactly what method you should use: manual threads, thread pool, delegates, and how to implement it to do just what your application needs, you are in trouble. I don't fully disagree, but I don't really see how that's relevant. This site is here specifically because programmers don't always have all the answers. If your application is complex enough to require throttling the number of threads that you use, aren't you almost always going to want more control than what the framework gives you? No. If I need a thread pool, I will use the one that's provided, unless and until I find that it is not sufficient. I will not simply assume that the provided thread pool is insufficient for my needs without confirming that to be the case. I'm not speaking as someone with only theoretical knowledge here. I write and maintain high volume applications that make heavy use of multithreading, and I generally don't find the thread pool to be the correct answer. Most of my professional experience has been with multithreading and multiprocessing programs. I have often needed to roll my own solution as well. That doesn't mean that the thread pool isn't useful, or appropriate in many cases. The thread pool is built to handle worker threads. In cases where multiple worker threads are appropriate, the provided thread pool should should generally be the first approach. "}

Ah, argument from authority - but always be on the look out for people who might be on the Windows kernel team. Neither of us were arguing with the fact that if you have some specific requirements then the .NET ThreadPool might not be the right thing. What we're objecting to is the trivialisation of the costs to the machine of creating a thread. The significant expense of creating a thread at the raison d'etre for the ThreadPool in the first place. I don't want my machines to be filled with code written by people who have been misinformed about the expense of creating a thread, and don't, for example, know that it causes a method to be called in every single DLL which is attached to the process (some of which will be created by 3rd parties), and which may well hot-up a load of code which need not be in RAM at all and almost certainly didn't need to be in L1.

If you are running on a server then you are going to want to use one of the XML based office generation formats as there are know issues when using Office Automation on a server. However, if you are working on the client machine then you have a choice of either using Office Automation or using the Office Open XML format (see links below), which is supported by Microsoft Office 2000 and up either natively or through service packs. One draw back to this though is that you might not be able to embed some kinds of graphs or images that you wish to show.

Surely the only reason is that there is something in a framework somewhere that isn't very thread-safe. That \"something\" is almost every single instance member on every single control in System.Windows.Forms. The MSDN documentation for many controls in System.Windows.Forms, if not all of them, say \"Any public static (Shared in Visual Basic) members of this type are thread safe. Any instance members are not guaranteed to be thread safe.\" This means that instance members such as TextBox.Text {get; set;} are not reentrant. Making each of those instance members thread safe could introduce a lot of overhead that most applications do not need. Instead the designers of the .Net framework decided, and I think correctly, that the burden of synchronizing access to forms controls from multiple threads should be put on the programmer.

I think many developers think of the database as a simple persistence layer for their objects, and are only concerned with the CRUD operations that those objects need. Too much effort is being put into the \"impedence mismatch\" between object and relational models. Here's an idea: stop trying. Write stored procedures to encapsulate your data. Use results sets, DataSet, DataTable, SqlCommand (or the java/php/whatever equivalent) as needed from code to interact with the database. You don't need those objects. An excellent example is embedding a SqlDataSource into a .ASPX page. You shouldn't try to hide your data from anyone. Developers need to understand exactly how and when they are interacting with the physical data store. Object-relational mappers are the devil. Stop using them. Building enterprise applications is often an exercise in managing complexity. You have to keep things as simple as possible, or you will have an absolutely un-maintainable system. If you are willing to allow some coupling (which is inherent in any application anyway), you can do away with both your business logic layer and your data access layer (replacing them with stored procedures), and you won't need any of those interfaces.

Unless your request processing is complex and heavy, your program is going to spend 99% of it's time waiting for the HTTP requests. This is exactly what Async IO is designed for - Let the windows networking stack (or .net framework or whatever) worry about all the waiting, and just use a single thread to dispatch and 'pick up' the results. Unfortunately the .NET framework makes it a right pain in the ass. It's easier if you're just using raw sockets or the Win32 api. Here's a (tested!) example using C#3 anyway: using System.Net; // need this somewhere // need to declare an class so we can cast our state object back out class RequestState { public WebRequest Request { get; set; } } static void Main( string[] args ) { // stupid cast neccessary to create the request HttpWebRequest request = WebRequest.Create( \"http://www.stackoverflow.com\" ) as HttpWebRequest; request.BeginGetResponse( /* callback to be invoked when finished */ (asyncResult) => { // fetch the request object out of the AsyncState var state = (RequestState)asyncResult.AsyncState; var webResponse = state.Request.EndGetResponse( asyncResult ) as HttpWebResponse; // there we go; Debug.Assert( webResponse.StatusCode == HttpStatusCode.OK ); Console.WriteLine( \"Got Response from server:\" + webResponse.Server ); }, /* pass the request through to our callback */ new RequestState { Request = request } ); // blah Console.WriteLine( \"Waiting for response. Press a key to quit\" ); Console.ReadKey(); } EDIT: In the case of .NET, the 'completion callback' actually gets fired in a ThreadPool thread, not in your main thread, so you will still need to lock any shared resources, but it still saves you all the trouble of managing threads.

We are strictly talking unit tests that need to be run as frequently as possible. Response roundup: Thanks for the great responses so far. Most advice seems to be don't worry about the speed -- concentrate on quality and just selectively run them if they are too slow.

However, I still try to make them reasonably fast. I think if they run on the order of milliseconds, you are fine. If they run a second or more per test... then you might be doing something that should be optimized. Slow tests only become a problem as the system matures and causes the build to take hours, at which point you are more likely running into an issue of a lot of kind of slow tests rather than one or 2 tests that you can optimize easily... thus you should probably pay attention RIGHT AWAY if you see lots of tests running hundreds of milliseconds each (or worse, seconds each), rather than wait till it gets to the hundreds of tests taking that long point (at which point it is going to be really hard to solve the problem). Even so, it will only reduce the time between when your automated build issues errors... which is ok if it is an hour later (or even a few hours later), I think. The problem is running them before you check in, but this can be avoided by selecting a small subset of tests to run that are related to what you are working on. Just make sure to fix the build if you check in code that breaks tests you didn't run! "}

As you can see we haven't yet reached the problem of tests being too time consuming. 10 seconds for me is the point where it starts to become intrusive, when we start to approach that it'll be something we'll take a look at. We'll likely move the lower level libraries, which are more robust since they change infrequently and have few dependencies, into the nightly builds, or a configuration where they're only executed by the build machine.

This has served me for years and apparently gives me 80+ words per minute, but it does seem an incredibly weird way to type. This is touch typing but not using the \"standard\" finger arrangement. While it's probably not a great idea to try and fix something that already works, I thought I'd try and relearn to type the proper way (left fingers on asdf and right fingers on jkl;). I've been trying out Mavis Beacon and it seems alright, it slowly adds more and more letters to your repertoire allowing you to gain the muscle memory or whatever, and then focuses on speed. The \"games\" seem a little pointless (is this program designed for kids?), but I guess for someone who doesn't know where the keys are it does a good job showing you which fingers to use and where to move them. As I already knew where the keys are most of the program didn't really aid me. Once you know where the keys are you probably just want to practice typing out text and a program like that won't really aid any more than notepad apart from counting your words per minute and giving you something to type. I agree with Typing of the dead being pretty awesome though, and will definitely help with your speed once you've got the finger arrangement down. Do all you touch typers use the standard finger arrangement or do you just do your own thing? I think I've come to the conclusion I'll just stick with what I know, it seems to work anyway. "}

Late binding uses CreateObject to create and instance of the application object, which you can then control. For example, to create a new instance of Excel using late binding: Dim oXL As Object Set oXL = CreateObject(\"Excel.Application\") On the other hand, to manipulate an existing instance of Excel (if Excel is already open) you would use GetObject (regardless whether you're using early or late binding): Dim oXL As Object Set oXL = GetObject(, \"Excel.Application\") To use early binding, you first need to set a reference in your project to the application you want to manipulate. In the VB Editor of any Office application, or in VB itself, you do this by selecting Tools + References, and selecting the application you want from the list (e.g. \u201cMicrosoft Excel 8.0 Object Library\u201d). To create a new instance of Excel using early binding: Dim oXL As Excel.Application Set oXL = New Excel.Application In either case, incidentally, you can first try to get an existing instance of Excel, and if that returns an error, you can create a new instance in your error handler.

{"user":"1190","questionId":"10580","creationDate":"2008-08-14T02:16:42.283","answerId":"10582","type":"answer","body":"In compiled languages, the difference is stark. Java: //early binding: public create_a_foo(*args) { return new Foo(args) } my_foo = create_a_foo(); //late binding: public create_something(Class klass, *args) { klass.new_instance(args) } my_foo = create_something(Foo); In the first example, the compiler can do all sorts of neat stuff at compile time. In the second, you just have to hope that whoever uses the method does so responsibly. (Of course, newer JVMs support the Class<? extends Foo> klass structure, which can greatly reduce this risk.) Another benefit is that IDEs can hotlink to the class definition, since it's declared right there in the method. The call to create_something(Foo) might be very far from the method definition, and if you're looking at the method definition, it might be nice to see the implementation. The major advantage of late binding is that it makes things like inversion-of-control easier, as well as certain other uses of polymorphism and duck-typing (if your language supports such things). "}
{"user":"1190","questionId":"10580","creationDate":"2008-08-14T02:21:56.207","answerId":"10584","type":"answer","body":"In interpreted languages, the difference is a little more subtle. Ruby: # early binding: def create_a_foo(*args) Foo.new(*args) end my_foo = create_a_foo # late binding: def create_something(klass, *args) klass.new(*args) end my_foo = create_something(Foo) Because Ruby is (generally) not compiled, there isn't a compiler to do the nifty up-front stuff. The growth of JRuby means that more Ruby is compiled these days, though, making it act more like Java, above. The issue with IDEs still stands: a platform like Eclipse can look up class definitions if you hard-code them, but cannot if you leave them up to the caller. Inversion-of-control is not terribly popular in Ruby, probably because of its extreme runtime flexibility, but Rails makes great use of late binding to reduce the amount of configuration necessary to get your application going.

That sounds like strong AI to me. Producing something like this, even just to recognize numbers, gets really hairy. For example is \"123.456\" one number or two? How about this \"123,456\"? Is \"35F\" a decimal number and an 'F' or is it the hex value 0x35F? You're going to have to build something that will parse in the way you need. You can do this with regular expressions, or you can do it with sscanf, or you can do it some other way, but you're going to have to write something custom. However, with basic regular expressions, you can do this yourself. It won't be magic, but it's not that much work. Something like this will parse the lines you're interested in and consolidate them (Perl): my @vals = (); while (defined(my $line = <>)) { if ($line =~ /The temperature at P(\\d*) is (\\d*)F./) { push(@vals, \"($1,$2)\"); } } print \"The temperature at P%d is %dF. {\"; for (my $i = 0; $i < @vals; $i++) { print $vals[$i]; if ($i < @vals - 1) { print \",\"; } } print \"}\\n\"; The output from this isL The temperature at P%d is %dF. {(1,35),(1,40),(3,35),(1,40)} You could do something similar for each type of line you need to parse.

PCRE was originally written for the Exim MTA, but is now used by many high-profile open source projects, including Apache, PHP, KDE, Postfix, Analog, and Nmap. PCRE has also found its way into some well known commercial products, like Apple Safari. Some other interesting projects using PCRE include Chicken, Ferite, Onyx, Hypermail, Leafnode, Askemos, and Wenlin. PCRE is mature, and has the support of numerous projects.

The clients of the RemotingService are ASP.NET instances (many many). Currently, the clients remoting call RemotingService and blocks while the RemotingService call is serviced. However, the remoting service is getting complicated enough (with more RPC calls and complex algorithms) that the asp.net worker threads are blocked for a significantly long time (4-5 seconds). According to this msdn article, doing this will not scale well because an asp.net worker thread is blocked for each remoting RPC. It advises switching to async handlers to free up asp.net worker threads. The purpose of an asynchronous handler is to free up an ASP.NET thread pool thread to service additional requests while the handler is processing the original request. This seems fine, except the remoting call still takes up a thread from the thread pool. Is this the same thread pool as the asp.net worker threads?

What I am curious about is when it is time to write unit tests... I will write them to cover as many sets of classes as possible. For example, if I have a Word class, I will write some unit tests for the Word class. Then, I begin writing my Sentence class, and when it needs to interact with the Word class, I will often write my unit tests such that they test both Sentence and Word... at least in the places where they interact. Have these tests essentially become integration tests because they now test the integration of these 2 classes, or is it just a unit test that spans 2 classes? In general, because of this uncertain line, I will rarely actually write integration tests... or is my using the finished product to see if all the pieces work properly the actual integration tests, even though they are manual and rarely repeated beyond the scope of each individual feature? Am I misunderstanding integration tests, or is there really just very little difference between integration and unit tests? Edit Thanks for all the great responses everyone! I think from the varied answers it's clear that the line between unit and integration tests is definitely a blurry line, and perhaps it's a bit pedantic to try and figure out which are which and the true focus should stay on the code (Thanks @Rob Cooper).

It would not be unreasonable to have the last statement in your main function flip a global exited_cleanly variable to true.

Part of this refactoring, has been to move code that's common to two of my models to a module that I can include where I need it. So far, so good. Looks like it's going to work out, but I've just hit a problem that I'm not sure how to get around. The module (which I've called sendable), is just going to be the code that handles faxing, e-mailing, or printing a PDF of the document. So, for example, I have a purchase order, and I have Internal Sales Orders (imaginatively abbreviated to ISO). The problem I've struck, is that I want some variables initialised (initialized for people who don't spell correctly :P ) after the object is loaded, so I've been using the after_initialize hook. No problem... until I start adding some more mixins. The problem I have, is that I can have an after_initialize in any one of my mixins, so I need to include a super call at the start to make sure the other mixin after_initialize calls get called. Which is great, until I end up calling super and I get an error because there is no super to call. Here's a little example, in case I haven't been confusing enough: class Iso < ActiveRecord::Base include Shared::TracksSerialNumberExtension include Shared::OrderLines extend Shared::Filtered include Sendable::Model validates_presence_of :customer validates_associated :lines owned_by :customer order_lines :despatched # Mixin tracks_serial_numbers :items # Mixin sendable :customer # Mixin attr_accessor :address def initialize( params = nil ) super self.created_at ||= Time.now.to_date end end So, if each one of the mixins have an after_initialize call, with a super call, how can I stop that last super call from raising the error? How can I test that the super method exists before I call it? "}

Therefore, would it not be best to wrap the user control's Render method, but rather than passing it the reference to the \"Live\" HtmlTextWriter, you pass your own, trap any Exceptions raised in this little safety \"bubble\", if all goes well, you then pass your resultant HTML to the actual HtmlTextWriter?

One viewpoint is that the data layer should be aware of business objects (our own classes that represent an entity), and be able to work with that object natively. The opposing viewpoint is that the data layer should be object-agnostic, and purely handle simple data types (strings, bools, dates, etc.) I can see that both approaches may be valid, but my own viewpoint is that I prefer the former. That way, if the data storage medium changes, the business layer doesn't (necessarily) have to change to accommodate the new data layer. It would therefore be a trivial thing to change from a SQL data store to a serialized xml filesystem store. My colleague's point of view is that the data layer shouldn't have to know about object definitions, and that as long as the data is passed about appropriately, that is enough.

Say that I have a view which can accept drag and drop, but only in certain areas. Once the user drags over one of these areas I call DragManager.acceptDrag(this) (from a DragEvent.DRAG_OVER handler), but if the user then moves out of this area I'd like to change the status of the drag to not accepted and show the DragManager.NONE feedback. However, neither calling DragManager.acceptDrag(null) nor DragManager.showFeedback(DragManager.NONE) seems to have any effect. Once I've accepted the drag an set the feedback type I can't seem to change it. Just to make it clear: the areas where the user should be able to drop are not components or even display objects, in fact they are just ranges in the text of a text field (like the selection). Had they been components of their own I could have solved it by making each of them accept drag events individually. I guess I could create proxy components that float over the text to emulate it, but I'd rather not if it isn't necessary. I've managed to get it working in both AIR and the browser now, but only by putting proxy components on top of the ranges of text where you should be able to drop things. That way I get the right feedback and drops are automatically unaccepted on drag exit. This is the oddest thing about D&D in AIR: DragManager.doDrag(initiator, source, event, dragImage, offsetX, offsetY); In browser-based Flex, offsetX and offsetY should be negative (so says the documentation, and it works fine). However, when running exactly the same code in AIR you have to make the offsets positive. The same numbers, but positive. That is very, very weird. I've tested some more and what @maclema works, but not if you run in AIR. It seems like drag and drop in AIR is different. It's really, really weird because not only is the feedback not showing correctly, and it's not possible to unaccept, but the coordinates are also completely off. I just tried my application in a browser instead of AIR and dragging and dropping is completely broken. Also, skipping the dragEnter handler works fine in AIR, but breaks everything when running in a browser. "}

Our codebase contains ALOT of legacy/archaic code which must be kept operational. Some of this code is older than me (originally written in the late 70s) and some members of our team are still on Visual Studio 6. However, a conclusion has thankfully been reached internally that our product is looking somewhat antiquated compared to our competitors', and that something needs to be done. I am currently working on a new area of the UI which is quite separate from the rest of the product. I have therefore been given the chance to try out 'new' technology stacks as a sort of proving ground before the long process of moving over the rest of the UI begins. I have been using C# with Windows Forms and the .net framework for a while in my spare time and enjoy it, but am somewhat worried about the headaches caused by interop. While this particular branch of the UI won't require much interop with the legacy C++ codebase, I can forsee this becoming an issue in the future. The alternative is just to continue with MFC, but try and take advantage of the new feature pack that shipped with VS2008. This I guess is the easiest option, but I worry about longevity and not taking advantage of the goodness that is .net... So, which do I pick? We're a small team so my recommendation will quite probably be accepted as a future direction for our development - I want to get it right. Is MFC dead? Is C#/Winforms the way forward? Is there anything else I'm totally missing? Help greatly appreciated! "}

Interop with C++ code is hugely simplified by refactoring non-UI code into class libraries using C++/CLI (as you've noted in your selection of tags). The only issue with WPF is that it may be hard to maintain the current look-and-feel. Moving to WinForms can be done while maintaining the current look of your GUI. WPF uses such a different model that to attempt to keep the current layout would probably be futile and would definitely not be in the spirit of WPF. WPF also apparently has poor performance on pre-Vista machines when more than one WPF process is running. My suggestion is to find out what your clients are using. If most have moved to Vista and your team is prepared to put in a lot of GUI work, I would say skip WinForms and move to WPF. Otherwise, definitely look seriously at WinForms. In either case, a class library in C++/CLI is the answer to your interop concerns. "}

I know this question seems simple - and I'm sure there's a simple answer, but I've been spinning my wheels for some time on this one. I am dealing with a legacy db which really can't be altered structurally. I have a details table which lists payment plans that have been accepted by a customer. Each payment plan has an ID which links back to a reference table to get the plan's terms, conditions, etc. In my object model, I have an AcceptedPlan class, and a Plan class. Originally, I used a many-to-one relationship from the detail table back to the ref table to model this relationship in NHibernate. I also created a one-to-many relationship going in the opposite direction from the Plan class over to the AcceptedPlan class. This was fine while I was simply reading data. I could go to my Plan object, which was a property of my AcceptedPlan class to read the plan's details. My problem arose when I had to start inserting new rows to the details table. From my reading, it seems the only way to create a new child object is to add it to the parent object and then save the session. But I don't want to have to create a new parent Plan object every time I want to create a new detail record. This seems like unnecessary overhead.

There are a lot of variables that govern it, such as the size of each row and the number of writes vs reads. Basically: high fill factor = quicker read, low = quicker write. However it's not quite that simple, as almost all writes will be to a subset of rows that need to be looked up first. For instance: set a fill factor to 10% and each single-row update will take 10 times as long to find the row it's changing, even though a page split would then be very unlikely. Generally you see fill factors 70% (very high write) to 95% (very high read). It's a bit of an art form. I find that a good way of thinking of fill factors is as pages in an address book - the more tightly you pack the addresses the harder it is to change them, but the slimmer the book. I think I explained it better on my blog. "}

Any dependencies that class requires is replaced with fake ones (mocks). Integration tests are those tests where multiple classes and their interactions are tested at the same time. Only some dependencies in these cases are faked/mocked. I wouldn't call Controller's integration tests unless one of their dependencies is a real one (i.e. not faked) (e.g. IFormsAuthentication). Separating the two types of tests is useful for testing the system at different levels. Also, integration tests tend to be long lived, and unit tests are supposed to be quick. The execution speed distinction means they're executed differently. In our dev processes, unit tests are run at check-in (which is fine cos they're super quick), and integration tests are run once/twice per day. I try and run integration tests as often as possible, but usually hitting the database/writing to files/making rpc's/etc slows. That raises another important point, unit tests should avoid hitting IO (e.g. disk, network, db). Otherwise they slow down alot. It takes a bit of effort to design these IO dependencies out - i can't admit I've been faithful to the \"unit tests must be fast\" rule, but if you are, the benefits on a much larger system become apparent very quickly.

To make a really long story short I am getting XML from a webservice of serialized objects. I have a page limit of how many things can be on a page. I've taken a data grid and made it page, sort across pages, and handle some basic filtering. In regards to paging I'm using a Dictionary keyed on the page and storing the XML for that page. This way whenever a user comes back to a page that I've saved into this dictionary I can grab the XML from local memory instead of hitting the webservice. Basically, I'm caching the data retrieved from each call to the webservice for a page of data. There are several things that can expire my cache. Filtering and sorting are the main reason. However, a user may edit a row of data in the grid by opening an editor. The data they edit could cause the data displayed in the row to be stale. I could easily go to the webservice and get the whole page of data, but since the page size is set at runtime I could be looking at a large amount of records to retrieve. So let me now get to the heart of the issue that I am experiencing. In order to prevent getting the whole page of data back I make a call to the webservice asking for the completely updated record (the editor handles saving its data). Since I'm using custom objects I need to serialize them on the server to XML (this is handled already for other portions of our software). All data is handled through XML in e4x. The cache in the Dictionary is stored as an XMLList. Now let me show you my code... var idOfReplacee:String = this._WebService.GetSingleModelXml.lastResult.*[0].*[0].@Id; var xmlToReplace:XMLList = this._DataPages[this._Options.PageIndex].Data.(@Id == idOfReplacee); if(xmlToReplace.length() > 0) { delete (this._DataPages[this._Options.PageIndex].Data.(@Id == idOfReplacee)[0]); this._DataPages[this._Options.PageIndex].Data += this._WebService.GetSingleModelXml.lastResult.*[0].*[0]; } Basically, I get the id of the node I want to replace. Then I find it in the cache's Data property (XMLList). I make sure it exists since the filter on the second line returns the XMLList. The problem I have is with the delete line. I cannot make that line delete that node from the list. The line following the delete line works. I've added the node to the list. How do I replace or delete that node (meaning the node that I find from the filter statement out of the .Data property of the cache)??? Hopefully the underscores for all of my variables do not stay escaped when this is posted! otherwise this.&#95 == this._ "}

We've found WebSVN to be amazingly slow - the repository is too large for it (I think).

Most of the tools I've seen are based on PHP, Java, Python, etc. All languages the team could learn, but I'd rather something that uses the skills we already have. Can you recommend a good web-based repository browser for SVN, ideally one that uses ASP.NET, SQL Server and that runs on IIS? "}

I need to be able to generate a deep clone of this object - so I write a Clone() method, and implement it with a simple BinaryFormatter serialize/deserialize - or perhaps I do the deep clone using some other technique which is more error prone and I'd like to make sure is tested. OK, so now (ok, I should have done it first) I'd like write tests which cover the cloning. All the members of the class are private, and my architecture is so good (!) that I haven't needed to write hundreds of public properties or other accessors. The class isn't IComparable or IEquatable, because that's not needed by the application. My unit tests are in a separate assembly to the production code. What approaches do people take to testing that the cloned object is a good copy? Do you write (or rewrite once you discover the need for the clone) all your unit tests for the class so that they can be invoked with either a 'virgin' object or with a clone of it? How would you test if part of the cloning wasn't deep enough - as this is just the kind of problem which can give hideous-to-find bugs later? "}

If the class isn't sealed, you can create a harness for it by extending it, and then exposing all your internals within the child class. Alternatively, you could use reflection (yech), or use MSTest's Accessor generators. You need to clone your object and then go through every single property and variable that your object has and determine if it was copied correctly or cloned correctly. "}
