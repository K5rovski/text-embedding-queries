"text": "Application-to-application messaging\nApplication-to-application messaging supports subscribers such as Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery streams, Lambda functions, Amazon SQS queues, HTTP/S endpoints, and AWS Event Fork Pipelines. For more information, see Using Amazon SNS for application-to-application (A2A) messaging.\n\nApplication-to-person notifications\nApplication-to-person notifications provide user notifications to subscribers such as mobile applications, mobile phone numbers, and email addresses. For more information, see Using Amazon SNS for application-to-person (A2P) messaging.\n\nStandard and FIFO topics\nUse a FIFO topic to ensure strict message ordering, to define message groups, and to prevent message duplication. Only Amazon SQS FIFO queues can subscribe to a FIFO topic. For more information, see Message ordering and deduplication (FIFO topics).\nUse a standard topic when message delivery order and possible message duplication are not critical. All of the supported delivery protocols can subscribe to a standard topic.\n\nMessage durability\nAmazon SNS uses a number of strategies that work together to provide message durability: Published messages are stored across multiple, geographically separated servers and data centers.\n\nIf a subscribed endpoint isn't available, Amazon SNS runs a delivery retry policy.\n\nTo preserve any messages that aren't delivered before the delivery retry policy ends, you can create a dead-letter queue. Message archiving and analytics\nYou can subscribe Kinesis Data Firehose delivery streams to SNS topics, which allow you to send notifications to additional archiving and analytics endpoints such  as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets, Amazon Redshift tables, and more.\n\nMessage attributes\n\nMessage attributes let you provide any arbitrary metadata about the message. Amazon SNS message attributes. Message filtering\n\nBy default, each subscriber receives every message published to the topic. To receive a subset of the messages, a subscriber must assign a filter policy to the topic subscription. When the incoming message attributes match the filter policy attributes, the message is delivered to the subscribed endpoint. Otherwise, the message is filtered out. For more information, see Amazon SNS message filtering. Message security\n\nServer-side encryption protects the contents of messages that are stored in Amazon SNS topics, using encryption keys provided by AWS KMS. For more information, see Encryption at rest.\nYou can also establish a private connection between Amazon SNS and your virtual private cloud (VPC). for more information, see Internetwork traffic privacy.",

Run your application code in Lambda functions on highly available compute infrastructure. For more information, see the AWS Lambda Developer Guide. You can subscribe a Lambda function to an SNS topic.\n\nAWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) helps you securely control access to AWS resources for your users. Use IAM to control who can use your Amazon SNS topics (authentication), what topics they can use, and how they can use them (authorization). For more information, see Using identity-based policies with Amazon SNS.\n\nAWS CloudFormation enables you to model and set up your AWS resources. Create a template that describes the AWS resources that you want, including Amazon SNS topics and subscriptions. AWS CloudFormation takes care of provisioning and configuring those resources for you.

If topics have been created under your AWS account before, on the navigation panel, choose Topics.\n\nOn the Topics page, choose Create topic. \nOn the Create topic page, in the Details section, do the following:\n\nFor Type, choose a topic type (Standard or FIFO).\n\nEnter a Name for the topic. For a FIFO topic, add .fifo to the end of the name.\n\n(Optional) Enter a Display name for the topic.\n\n(Optional) For a FIFO topic, you can choose content-based message deduplication to enable default message deduplication. For more information, see Message deduplication for FIFO topics. (Optional) Expand the Encryption section and do the following. For more information, see Encryption at rest.\n\nChoose Enable encryption.\n\nSpecify the customer master key (CMK). For more information, see Key terms.\nFor each CMK type, the Description, Account, and CMK ARN are displayed.\nImportantIf you aren't the owner of the CMK, or if you log in with an account that doesn't have the kms:ListAliases and kms:DescribeKey permissions, you won't be able to view information about the CMK on the Amazon SNS console.Ask the owner of the CMK to grant you these permissions. For more information, see the AWS KMS API Permissions: Actions and Resources Reference in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide. The AWS managed CMK for Amazon SNS (Default) alias/aws/sns is selected by default.\nNoteKeep the following in mind:\n\nThe first time you use the AWS Management Console to specify the AWS managed CMK for Amazon SNS for a topic, AWS KMS creates the AWS managed CMK for Amazon SNS.\n\nAlternatively, the first time you use the Publish action on a topic with SSE enabled, AWS KMS creates the AWS managed CMK for Amazon SNS. To use a custom CMK from your AWS account, choose the Customer master key (CMK) field and then choose the custom CMK from the list.\nNoteFor instructions on creating custom CMKs, see Creating Keys in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide\n\nTo use a custom CMK ARN from your AWS account or from another AWS account, enter it into the Customer master key (CMK) field. (Optional) By default, only the topic owner can publish or subscribe to the topic. To configure additional access permissions, expand the Access policy section. For more information, see Identity and access management in Amazon SNS and Example cases for Amazon SNS access control. \nNoteWhen you create a topic using the console, the default policy uses the aws:SourceOwner condition key. This key is similar to aws:SourceAccount. (Optional) To configure how Amazon SNS retries failed message delivery attempts, expand the Delivery retry policy (HTTP/S) section. For more information, see Amazon SNS message delivery retries.\n\n(Optional) To configure how Amazon SNS logs the delivery of messages to CloudWatch, expand the Delivery status logging section. For more information, see Amazon SNS message delivery status.\n\n(Optional) To add metadata tags to the topic, expand the Tags section, enter a Key and a Value (optional) and choose Add tag. For more information, see Amazon SNS topic tagging.\n\nChoose Create topic.\nThe topic is created and the MyTopic page is displayed.\nThe topic's Name, ARN, (optional) Display name, and Topic owner's AWS account ID are displayed in the Details section.\n\nCopy the topic ARN to the clipboard, for example:\narn:aws:sns:us-east-2:123456789012:MyTopic",

Calculate the total combination by multiplying the number of values in each array.\nConsider the following policy:\n{ \"key_a\": [\"value_one\", \"value_two\", \"value_three\"], \"key_b\": [\"value_one\"], \"key_c\": [\"value_one\", \"value_two\"]\n}\nThe first array has three values, the second has one value, and the third has two values. The total combination is calculated as follows:\n3 x 1 x 2 = 6\n\nAmazon SNS compares policy attributes only to message attributes that have the following data types: String\n\nString.Array\n\nNumber Amazon SNS ignores message attributes with the Binary data type.\n\nThe JSON of the filter policy can contain the following: strings enclosed in quotation marks\n\nnumbers\n\nthe keywords true, false, and null, without quotation marks When you use the Amazon SNS API, you must pass the JSON of the filter policy as a valid UTF-8 string.\n\nA filter policy can have a maximum of 5 attribute names.\n\nThe maximum size of a policy is 256 KB.\n\nBy default, you can have up to 200 filter policies per AWS account.

You'll enter this role's Amazon Resource Name (ARN) as the SubscriptionRoleARN when you create the subscription.

Or, to provide stricter permissions for using Kinesis Data Firehose, you can create your own policy.

"text": "To set up your endpoint to process subscription confirmation and notification messages\nYour code should read the HTTP headers of the HTTP POST requests that Amazon SNS sends to your endpoint. Your code should look for the header field x-amz-sns-message-type, which tells you the type of message that Amazon SNS has sent to you. By looking at the header, you can determine the message type without having to parse the body of the HTTP request. There are two types that you need to handle: SubscriptionConfirmation and Notification. The UnsubscribeConfirmation message is used only when the subscription is deleted from the topic.\nFor details about the HTTP header, see HTTP/HTTPS headers. The following HTTP POST request is an example of a subscription confirmation message.\nPOST / HTTP/1.1 x-amz-sns-message-type: SubscriptionConfirmation x-amz-sns-message-id: 165545c9-2a5c-472c-8df2-7ff2be2b3b1b x-amz-sns-topic-arn: arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:MyTopic Content-Length: 1336 Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8 Host: example.com Connection: Keep-Alive User-Agent: Amazon Simple Notification Service Agent { \"Type\" : \"SubscriptionConfirmation\", \"MessageId\" : \"165545c9-2a5c-472c-8df2-7ff2be2b3b1b\", \"Token\" : \"2336412f37f...\", \"TopicArn\" : \"arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:MyTopic\", \"Message\" : \"You have chosen to subscribe to the topic arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:MyTopic.\\nTo confirm the subscription, visit the SubscribeURL included in this message.\", \"SubscribeURL\" : \"https://sns.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/?Action=ConfirmSubscription&TopicArn=arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:MyTopic&Token=2336412f37...\", \"Timestamp\" : \"2012-04-26T20:45:04.751Z\", \"SignatureVersion\" : \"1\", \"Signature\" : \"EXAMPLEpH+...\", \"SigningCertURL\" : \"https://sns.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/SimpleNotificationService-f3ecfb7224c7233fe7bb5f59f96de52f.pem\"\n}\n\nYour code should parse the JSON document in the body of the HTTP POST request to read the name-value pairs that make up the Amazon SNS message. Use a JSON parser that handles converting the escaped representation of control characters back to their ASCII character values (for example, converting \\n to a newline character). You can use an existing JSON parser such as the Jackson JSON Processor or write your own. In order to send the text in the subject and message fields as valid JSON, Amazon SNS must convert some control characters to escaped representations that can be included in the JSON document. When you receive the JSON document in the body of the POST request sent to your endpoint, you must convert the escaped characters back to their original character values if you want an exact representation of the original subject and messages published to the topic. This is critical if you want to verify the signature of a notification because the signature uses the message and subject in their original forms as part of the string to sign.\n\nYour code should verify the authenticity of a notification, subscription confirmation, or unsubscribe confirmation message sent by Amazon SNS. Using information contained in the Amazon SNS message, your endpoint can recreate the signature so that you can verify the contents of the message by matching your signature with the signature that Amazon SNS sent with the message. For more information about verifying the signature of a message, see Verifying the signatures of Amazon SNS messages.\n\nBased on the type specified by the header field x-amz-sns-message-type, your code should read the JSON document contained in the body of the HTTP request and process the message. Here are the guidelines for handling the two primary types of messages: SubscriptionConfirmation\n\nRead the value for SubscribeURL and visit that URL. To confirm the subscription and start receiving notifications at the endpoint, you must visit the SubscribeURLURL (for example, by sending an HTTP GET request to the URL). See the example HTTP request in the previous step to see what the SubscribeURL looks like. For more information about the format of the SubscriptionConfirmation message, see HTTP/HTTPS subscription confirmation JSON format. When you visit the URL, you will get back a response that looks like the following XML document. The document returns the subscription ARN for the endpoint within the ConfirmSubscriptionResult element.\n<ConfirmSubscriptionResponse xmlns=\"http://sns.amazonaws.com/doc/2010-03-31/\"> <ConfirmSubscriptionResult> <SubscriptionArn>arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:MyTopic:2bcfbf39-05c3-41de-beaa-fcfcc21c8f55</SubscriptionArn> </ConfirmSubscriptionResult> <ResponseMetadata> <RequestId>075ecce8-8dac-11e1-bf80-f781d96e9307</RequestId> </ResponseMetadata>\n</ConfirmSubscriptionResponse>\nAs an alternative to visiting the SubscribeURL, you can confirm the subscription using the ConfirmSubscription action with the Token set to its corresponding value in the SubscriptionConfirmation message. If you want to allow only the topic owner and subscription owner to be able to unsubscribe the endpoint, you call the ConfirmSubscription action with an AWS signature.\n\nNotification\n\nRead the values for Subject and Message to get the notification information that was published to the topic.\nFor details about the format of the Notification message, see HTTP/HTTPS headers. The following HTTP POST request is an example of a notification message sent to the endpoint example.com.\nPOST / HTTP/1.1 x-amz-sns-message-type: Notification x-amz-sns-message-id: 22b80b92-fdea-4c2c-8f9d-bdfb0c7bf324 x-amz-sns-topic-arn: arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:MyTopic x-amz-sns-subscription-arn: arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:MyTopic:c9135db0-26c4-47ec-8998-413945fb5a96 Content-Length: 773 Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8 Host: example.com Connection: Keep-Alive User-Agent: Amazon Simple Notification Service Agent { \"Type\" : \"Notification\", \"MessageId\" : \"22b80b92-fdea-4c2c-8f9d-bdfb0c7bf324\", \"TopicArn\" : \"arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:MyTopic\", \"Subject\" : \"My First Message\", \"Message\" : \"Hello world!\", \"Timestamp\" : \"2012-05-02T00:54:06.655Z\", \"SignatureVersion\" : \"1\", \"Signature\" : \"EXAMPLEw6JRN...\", \"SigningCertURL\" : \"https://sns.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/SimpleNotificationService-f3ecfb7224c7233fe7bb5f59f96de52f.pem\", \"UnsubscribeURL\" : \"https://sns.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/?Action=Unsubscribe&SubscriptionArn=arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:MyTopic:c9135db0-26c4-47ec-8998-413945fb5a96\"\n} Make sure that your endpoint responds to the HTTP POST message from Amazon SNS with the appropriate status code. The connection will time out in 15 seconds. If your endpoint does not respond before the connection times out or if your endpoint returns a status code outside the range of 200\u00e2\u0080\u00934xx, Amazon SNS will consider the delivery of the message as a failed attempt.\n\nMake sure that your code can handle message delivery retries from Amazon SNS. If Amazon SNS doesn't receive a successful response from your endpoint, it attempts to deliver the message again. This applies to all messages, including the subscription confirmation message. By default, if the initial delivery of the message fails, Amazon SNS attempts up to three retries with a delay between failed attempts set at 20 seconds.\nNoteThe message request times out after 15 seconds. This means that, if the message delivery failure is caused by a timeout, Amazon SNS retries for approximately 35 seconds after the previous delivery attempt. You can set a different delivery policy for the endpoint.\nTo be clear, Amazon SNS attempts to retry only after a delivery x-amz-sns-message-id header field. By comparing the IDs of the messages you have processed with incoming messages, you can determine whether the message is a retry attempt.\n\nIf you are subscribing an HTTPS endpoint, make sure that your endpoint has a server certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). Amazon SNS will only send messages to HTTPS endpoints that have a server certificate signed by a CA trusted by Amazon SNS.\n\nDeploy the code that you have created to receive Amazon SNS messages. When you subscribe the endpoint, the endpoint must be ready to receive at least the subscription confirmation message.",

"text": "To verify the signature of an Amazon SNS message when using HTTP query-based requests\nExtract the name-value pairs from the JSON document in the body of the HTTP POST request that Amazon SNS sent to your endpoint. You'll be using the values of some of the name-value pairs to create the string to sign. When you are verifying the signature of an Amazon SNS message, it is critical that you convert the escaped control characters to their original character representations in the Message and Subject values. These values must be in their original forms when you use them as part of the string to sign. For information about how to parse the JSON document, see Step 1: Make sure your endpoint is ready to process Amazon SNS messages. \nThe SignatureVersion tells you the signature version. From the signature version, you can determine the requirements for how to generate the signature. For Amazon SNS notifications, Amazon SNS currently supports signature version 1. This section provides the steps for creating a signature using signature version 1.\n\nGet the X509 certificate that Amazon SNS used to sign the message. The SigningCertURL value points to the location of the X509 certificate used to create the digital signature for the message. Retrieve the certificate from this location. Extract the public key from the certificate. The public key from the certificate specified by SigningCertURL is used to verify the authenticity and integrity of the message. Determine the message type. The format of the string to sign depends on the message type, which is specified by the Type value.\n\nCreate the string to sign. The string to sign is a newline character\u00e2\u0080\u0093delimited list of specific name-value pairs from the message. Each name-value pair is represented with the name first followed by a newline character, followed by the value, and ending with a newline character. The name-value pairs must be listed in byte-sort order.\nDepending on the message type, the string to sign must have the following name-value pairs. Notification\n\nNotification messages must contain the following name-value pairs:\nMessage\nMessageId\nSubject (if included in the message)\nTimestamp\nTopicArn\nType The following example is a string to sign for a Notification.\nMessage\nMy Test Message\nMessageId\n4d4dc071-ddbf-465d-bba8-08f81c89da64\nSubject\nMy subject\nTimestamp\n2019-01-31T04:37:04.321Z\nTopicArn\narn:aws:sns:us-east-2:123456789012:s4-MySNSTopic-1G1WEFCOXTC0P\nType\nNotification\n\nSubscriptionConfirmation and UnsubscribeConfirmation\n\nSubscriptionConfirmation and UnsubscribeConfirmation messages must contain the following name-value pairs:\nMessage\nMessageId\nSubscribeURL\nTimestamp\nToken\nTopicArn\nType\nThe following example is a string to sign for a SubscriptionConfirmation.\nMessage\nMy Test Message\nMessageId\n3d891288-136d-417f-bc05-901c108273ee\nSubscribeURL\nhttps://sns.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/?Action=ConfirmSubscription&TopicArn=arn:aws:sns:us-east-2:123456789012:s4-MySNSTopic-1G1WEFCOXTC0P&Token=233...\nTimestamp\n2019-01-31T19:25:13.719Z\nToken\n233...\nTopicArn\narn:aws:sns:us-east-2:123456789012:s4-MySNSTopic-1G1WEFCOXTC0P\nType\nSubscriptionConfirmation Decode the Signature value from Base64 format. The message delivers the signature in the Signature value, which is encoded as Base64. Before you compare the signature value with the signature you have calculated, make sure that you decode the Signature value from Base64 so that you compare the values using the same format.\n\nGenerate the derived hash value of the Amazon SNS message. Submit the Amazon SNS message, in canonical format, to the same hash function used to generate the signature. Generate the asserted hash value of the Amazon SNS message. The asserted hash value is the result of using the public key value (from step 3) to decrypt the signature delivered with the Amazon SNS message. Verify the authenticity and integrity of the Amazon SNS message. Compare the derived hash value (from step 7) to the asserted hash value (from step 8). If the values are identical, then the receiver is assured that the message has not been modified while in transit and the message must have originated from Amazon SNS. If the values are not identical, it should not be trusted by the receiver.",

"text": "For event archiving and analytics, Amazon SNS now recommends using its native integration with Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose. You can subscribe Kinesis Data Firehose delivery streams to SNS topics, which allows you to send notifications to archiving and analytics endpoints such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets, Amazon Redshift tables, Amazon OpenSearch Service (OpenSearch Service), and more. Using Amazon SNS with Kinesis Data Firehose delivery streams is a fully-managed and codeless solution that doesn't require you to use AWS Lambda functions. For more information, see Fanout to Kinesis Data Firehose delivery streams.",

"text": "Register your company. \nBefore you can request a 10DLC, your company must be registered with The Campaign Registry; for information, see Registering a company. Registration is typically instantaneous unless The Campaign Registry requires more information. There is a one-time registration fee to register your company, displayed on the registration page. This one-time fee is paid separately from your monthly charges for the campaign and 10DLC. \nNoteAmazon SNS SMS messaging is available in Regions where Amazon Pinpoint is not currently supported. In these cases, open the Amazon Pinpoint console in the US East (N. Virginia) Region to register your 10DLC company and campaign, but do not request a 10DLC number. Instead, open a case in the AWS Support Center to request a 10DLC number in the AWS Region where you use or plan to use Amazon SNS to send SMS messages. For information on Regions where Amazon Pinpoint is available, see Amazon Pinpoint endpoints and quotas in the AWS General Reference. (Optional, but recommended) Apply for vetting\nIf your company registration is successful, you can begin creating low-volume, mixed-use 10DLC campaigns. These campaigns can send 75 messages per minute to recipients who use AT&T, and your registered company can send 2,000 messages per day to recipients who use T-Mobile. If your use case requires a throughput rate that exceeds these values, you can apply for vetting of your company registration. Vetting your company registration can increase the throughput rates for your companies and campaigns, but it isn't guaranteed to do so. For more information about vetting, see Vetting your Amazon SNS 10DLC registration.\n\nRegister your campaign.\nAfter your company is registered, create a 10DLC campaign and associate it with one of your registered companies. This campaign is submitted to The Campaign Registry for approval. In most cases, 10DLC campaign approval is instantaneous unless The Campaign Registry requires more information. For more information, see Registering a 10DLC campaign. Request your 10DLC number.\nAfter your 10DLC campaign is approved, you can request a 10DLC and associate that number with the approved campaign. Your 10DLC campaign can only use a number approved for it. See Requesting 10DLC numbers, toll-free numbers, and P2P long codes for SMS messaging with Amazon SNS.",

If you plan to use multiple message templates for this 10DLC campaign, include them as well.\nImportantDon't use placeholder text for your sample messages. The example messages that you provide should reflect the actual messages that you plan to send as accurately as possible. The Campaign and content attributes section contains a series of Yes or No questions related to the particular features of the campaign. Some attributes are mandatory, so you can't change the default value.\nMake sure that the attributes you choose are accurate for your campaign.\nIndicate whether each of the following applies to the campaign that you're registering: Subscriber opt-in \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Subscribers can opt in to receive messages about this campaign.\n\nSubscriber opt-out \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Subscribers can opt out of receiving messages about this campaign.\n\nSubscriber help \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Subscribers can contact the message sender after sending the HELP keyword.\n\nNumber pooling \u00e2\u0080\u0093 This 10DLC campaign uses more than 50 phone numbers.

Choose Create. \nAfter you submit the registration details for your campaign, the SMS and voice page opens. A message appears indicating that your campaign was submitted and is under review. You can see the status of your request on the 10DLC campaigns tab. You can check the status of your registration on the 10DLC tab, which will be one of the following: Active \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Your 10DLC campaign was approved.  You can request a 10DLC phone number and associate that number with your campaign.

Amazon SNS uses the Subject that you enter as the email subject line.\n\n(Optional) For Time to Live (TTL), enter a number of seconds that Amazon SNS has to send your SMS message to any mobile application endpoint subscribers.

Or, choose Custom payload for each delivery protocol to customize the message for subscribers of different protocol types. For example, you can enter a default message for phone number subscribers and a custom message for email subscribers.\n\nFor Message body to send to the endpoint, enter your message, or your custom messages per delivery protocol.\nIf your topic has a display name, Amazon SNS adds it to the message, which increases the message length.

"text": "Sign in to the Amazon SNS console.\nIn the console menu, choose an AWS Region that supports SMS messaging.\n\nIn the navigation pane, choose Text messaging (SMS).\n\nOn the Mobile text messaging (SMS) page, choose Publish text message.\n\nOn the Publish SMS message page, for Message type, choose one of the following: Promotional \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Non-critical messages, such as marketing messages.\n\nTransactional \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Critical messages that support customer transactions, such as one-time passcodes for multi-factor authentication.\n\nNoteThis message-level setting overrides your account-level default message type. You can set an account-level default message type from the Text messaging preferences section of the Mobile text messaging (SMS) page.\nFor pricing information for promotional and transactional messages, see Worldwide SMS Pricing.\n\nFor Destination phone number, enter the phone number to which you want to send the message.\n\nFor Message, enter the message to send.\n\n(Optional) Under Origination identities, specify how to identify yourself to your recipients: To specify a Sender ID, type a custom ID that contains 3-11 alphanumeric characters, including at least one letter and no spaces. The sender ID is displayed as the message sender on the receiving device. For example, you can use your business brand to make the message source easier to recognize.\nSupport for sender IDs varies by country and/or region. For example, messages delivered to U.S. phone numbers will not display the sender ID. For the countries and regions that support sender IDs, see Supported Regions and countries.\nIf you do not specify a sender ID, one of the following is displayed as the originating identity: In countries that support long codes, the long code is shown.\n\nIn countries where only sender IDs are supported, NOTICE is shown.\n\nThis message-level sender ID overrides your default sender ID, which you set on the Text messaging preferences page.\n\nTo specify an Origination number, enter a string of 5-14 numbers to display as the sender's phone number on the receiver's device. This string must match an origination number that is configured in your AWS account for the destination country. The origination number can be a 10DLC number, toll-free number, person-to-person long code, or short codes. For more information, see Origination identities for SMS messages.\nIf you don't specify an origination number, Amazon SNS selects an origination number to use for the SMS text message, based on your AWS account configuration. If you're sending SMS messages to recipients in India, expand Country-specific attributes, and specify the following attributes: Entity ID \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The entity ID or principal entity (PE) ID for sending SMS messages to recipients in India. This ID is a unique string of 1\u00e2\u0080\u009350 characters that the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) provides to identify the entity that you registered with the TRAI.\n\nTemplate ID \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The template ID for sending SMS messages to recipients in India. This ID is a unique, TRAI-provided string of 1\u00e2\u0080\u009350 characters that identifies the template that you registered with the TRAI. The template ID must be associated with the sender ID that you specified for the message.\n\nFor more information on sending SMS messages to recipients in India, see Special requirements for sending SMS messages to recipients in India.\n\nChoose Publish message.",

If Amazon SNS determines that sending the message would incur a cost that exceeds your maximum price, it doesn't send the message.\nThis attribute has no effect if your month-to-date SMS costs have already exceeded the quota set for the MonthlySpendLimit attribute. You can set the MonthlySpendLimit attribute using the SetSMSAttributes request.\nIf you're sending the message to an Amazon SNS topic, the maximum price applies to each message delivery to each phone number that is subscribed to the topic.\n\nAWS.SNS.SMS.SMSType\n\nThe type of message that you're sending: Promotional (default) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Non-critical messages, such as marketing messages.\n\nTransactional \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Critical messages that support customer transactions, such as one-time passcodes for multi-factor authentication.\n\nThis message-level attribute overrides the account-level attribute DefaultSMSType, which you can set using the SetSMSAttributes request.\n\nAWS.MM.SMS.EntityId\n\nThis attribute is required only for sending SMS messages to recipients in India.\nThis is your entity ID or principal entity (PE) ID for sending SMS messages to recipients in India. This ID is a unique string of 1\u00e2\u0080\u009350 characters that the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) provides to identify the entity that you registered with the TRAI.\n\nAWS.MM.SMS.TemplateId\n\nThis attribute is required only for sending SMS messages to recipients in India.\nThis is your template for sending SMS messages to recipients in India. This ID is a unique, TRAI-provided string of 1\u00e2\u0080\u009350 characters that identifies the template that you registered with the TRAI. The template ID must be associated with the sender ID that you specified for the message.",

On the next page, choose Allow to give Amazon SNS write access to your account's resources.\n\nTo use an existing service role, choose Use existing service role and then paste the ARN name in the IAM role for successful and failed deliveries box.\nThe service role you specify must allow write access to your account's resources.

You can use this sample app to help you get started with uploading your existing tokens. Note The following steps use the Eclipse Java IDE. The steps assume you have installed the AWS SDK for Java and you have the AWS security credentials for your AWS account. For more information, see AWS SDK for Java. For more information about credentials, see How Do I Get Security Credentials? in the AWS General Reference. Download and unzip the snsmobilepush.zip file. Create a new Java Project in Eclipse. Import the SNSSamples folder to the top-level directory of the newly created Java Project. In Eclipse, right-choose the name of the Java Project and then choose Import, expand General, choose File System, choose Next, browse to the SNSSamples folder, choose OK, and then choose Finish. Download a copy of the OpenCSV library and add it to the Build Path of the bulkupload package. Open the BulkUpload.properties file contained in the bulkupload package. Add the following to BulkUpload.properties: The ApplicationArn to which you want to add endpoints.\n\nThe absolute path for the location of your CSV file containing the tokens.\n\nThe names for CSV files (such as goodTokens.csv and badTokens.csv) to be created for logging the tokens that Amazon SNS parses correctly and those that fail.\n\n(Optional) The characters to specify the delimiter and quote in the CSV file containing the tokens.\n\n(Optional) The number of threads to use to concurrently create endpoints. The default is 1 thread.\n\nYour completed BulkUpload.properties should look similar to the following:\napplicationarn:arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:111122223333:app/FCM/fcmpushapp\ncsvfilename:C:\\\\mytokendirectory\\\\mytokens.csv\ngoodfilename:C:\\\\mylogfiles\\\\goodtokens.csv\nbadfilename:C:\\\\mylogfiles\\\\badtokens.csv\ndelimiterchar:' \nquotechar:\"\nnumofthreads:5 Run the BatchCreatePlatformEndpointSample.java application to upload the tokens to Amazon SNS. In this example, the endpoints that were created for the tokens that were uploaded successfully to Amazon SNS would be logged to goodTokens.csv, while the malformed tokens would be logged to badTokens.csv. In addition, you should see STD OUT logs written to the console of Eclipse, containing content similar to the following: \n<1>[SUCCESS] The endpoint was created with Arn arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:111122223333:app/FCM/fcmpushapp/165j2214-051z-3176-b586-138o3d420071\n<2>[ERROR: MALFORMED CSV FILE] Null token found in /mytokendirectory/mytokens.csv",

We recommend that you use temporary credentials that expire after a period of time. For most scenarios, we recommend that you use Amazon Cognito to create temporary security credentials. For more information, see the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide . If you would like to be notified when an app registers with Amazon SNS, you can register to receive an Amazon SNS event that will provide the new endpoint ARN. You can also use the ListEndpointByPlatformApplication API to obtain the full list of endpoints registered with Amazon SNS. Use a proxy server: If your application infrastructure is already set up for your mobile apps to call in and register on each installation, you can continue to use this setup. Your server will act as a proxy and pass the device token to Amazon SNS mobile push notifications, along with any user data you would like to store. For this purpose, the proxy server will connect to Amazon SNS using your AWS credentials and use the CreatePlatformEndpoint API call to upload the token information. The newly created endpoint Amazon Resource Name (ARN) will be returned, which your server can store for making subsequent publish calls to Amazon SNS.",

You can use these CMKs to protect the messages in Amazon SNS topics. \nNoteKeep the following in mind:\n\nThe first time you use the AWS Management Console to specify the AWS managed CMK for Amazon SNS for a topic, AWS KMS creates the AWS managed CMK for Amazon SNS.\n\nAlternatively, the first time you use the Publish action on a topic with SSE enabled, AWS KMS creates the AWS managed CMK for Amazon SNS.\n You can create CMKs, define the policies that control how CMKs can be used, and audit CMK usage using the Customer managed keys section of the AWS KMS console or the CreateKey AWS KMS action. For more information, see Customer Master Keys (CMKs) and Creating Keys in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide. For more examples of CMK identifiers, see KeyId in the AWS Key Management Service API Reference.

To get the hostname in the Amazon EC2 console: Choose Instances, choose your instance, and find the value for Public DNS (IPv4). From your instance, use the Amazon SNS publish command with the AWS CLI. You can send a simple message to a topic with the following command:\n$ aws sns publish --region aws-region --topic-arn sns-topic-arn --message \"Hello\"\nWhere: aws-region is the AWS Region that the topic is located in.\n\nsns-topic-arn is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the topic. To get the ARN from the Amazon SNS console: Choose Topics, find your topic, and find the value in the ARN column.\n\nIf the message is successfully received by Amazon SNS, the terminal prints a message ID, like the following:\n{ \"MessageId\": \"6c96dfff-0fdf-5b37-88d7-8cba910a8b64\"\n}",

"text": "AWS account root user \u00e2\u0080\u0093 When you first create an AWS account, you begin with a single sign-in identity that has complete access to all AWS services and resources in the account. This identity is called the AWS account root user and is accessed by signing in with the email address and password that you used to create the account. We strongly recommend that you do not use the root user for your everyday tasks, even the administrative ones. Instead, adhere to the best practice of using the root user only to create your first IAM user. Then securely lock away the root user credentials and use them to perform only a few account and service management tasks. IAM user \u00e2\u0080\u0093 An IAM user is an identity within your AWS account that has specific custom permissions (for example, permissions to create a topic in Amazon SNS). You can use an IAM user name and password to sign in to secure AWS webpages like the AWS Management Console, AWS Discussion Forums, or the AWS Support Center.\nIn addition to a user name and password, you can also generate access keys for each user. You can use these keys when you access AWS services programmatically, either through one of the several SDKs or by using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI). The SDK and CLI tools use the access keys to cryptographically sign your request. If you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t use AWS tools, you must sign the request yourself. Amazon SNS supports Signature Version 4, a protocol for authenticating inbound API requests. For more information about authenticating requests, see Signature Version 4 signing process in the AWS General Reference.\n\nIAM role \u00e2\u0080\u0093 An IAM role is an IAM identity that you can create in your account that has specific permissions. An IAM role is similar to an IAM user in that it is an AWS identity with permissions policies that determine what the identity can and cannot do in AWS. However, instead of being uniquely associated with one person, a role is intended to be assumable by anyone who needs it. Also, a role does not have standard long-term credentials such as a password or access keys associated with it. Instead, when you assume a role, it provides you with temporary security credentials for your role session. IAM roles with temporary credentials are useful in the following situations: Federated user access \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Instead of creating an IAM user, you can use existing identities from AWS Directory Service, your enterprise user directory, or a web identity provider. These are known as federated users. AWS assigns a role to a federated user when access is requested through an identity provider. For more information about federated users, see Federated users and roles in the IAM User Guide. AWS service access \u00e2\u0080\u0093 A service role is an IAM role that a service assumes to perform actions on your behalf. An IAM administrator can create, modify, and delete a service role from within IAM. For more information, see Creating a role to delegate permissions to an AWS service in the IAM User Guide. Applications running on Amazon EC2 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 You can use an IAM role to manage temporary credentials for applications that are running on an EC2 instance and making AWS CLI or AWS API requests. This is preferable to storing access keys within the EC2 instance. To assign an AWS role to an EC2 instance and make it available to all of its applications, you create an instance profile that is attached to the instance. An instance profile contains the role and enables programs that are running on the EC2 instance to get temporary credentials. For more information, see Using an IAM role to grant permissions to applications running on Amazon EC2 instances in the IAM User Guide.",

For example, you use the Amazon SNS SetTopicAttributes action to upload a policy for a particular Amazon SNS topic. 3 Someone sends a request to use your resource.\nFor example, a user sends a request to Amazon SNS to use one of your topics. 4 The AWS service determines which policies are applicable to the request.\nFor example, Amazon SNS looks at all the available Amazon SNS policies and determines which ones are applicable (based on what the resource is, who the requester is, etc.). 5 The AWS service evaluates the policies.\nFor example, Amazon SNS evaluates the policies and determines if the requester is allowed to use your topic or not. For information about the decision logic, see Evaluation logic. 6 The AWS service either denies the request or continues to process it. \nFor example, based on the policy evaluation result, the service either returns an \"Access denied\" error to the requester or continues to process the request.",

"text": "Example 4: Allow a partner to publish messages to a particular topicYou can use an Amazon SNS policy or an IAM policy to allow a partner to publish to a specific topic. If your partner has an AWS account, it might be easier to use an Amazon SNS policy. However, anyone in the partner's company who possesses the AWS security credentials could publish messages to the topic. This example assumes that you want to limit access to a particular person (or application). To do this you need to treat the partner like a user within your own company, and use a IAM policy instead of an Amazon SNS policy.For this example, we create a group called WidgetCo that represents the partner company; we create a user for the specific person (or application) at the partner company who needs access; and then we put the user in the group. We then attach a policy that grants the group Publish access on the specific topic named WidgetPartnerTopic. We also want to prevent the WidgetCo group from doing anything else with topics, so we add a statement that denies permission to any Amazon SNS actions other than Publish on any topics other than WidgetPartnerTopic. This is necessary only if there's a broad policy elsewhere in the system that grants users wide access to Amazon SNS. { \"Statement\": [{ \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"sns:Publish\", \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:sns:*:123456789012:WidgetPartnerTopic\" }, { \"Effect\": \"Deny\", \"NotAction\": \"sns:Publish\", \"NotResource\": \"arn:aws:sns:*:123456789012:WidgetPartnerTopic\" } ]\n}",

Choose Alarms, and then choose the Create Alarm button. This launches the Create Alarm wizard. Scroll through the Amazon SNS metrics to locate the metric you want to place an alarm on. Select the metric to create an alarm on and choose Continue. Fill in the Name, Description, Threshold, and Time values for the metric, and then choose Continue. Choose Alarm as the alarm state. If you want CloudWatch to send you an email when the alarm state is reached, choose either an existing Amazon SNS topic or choose Create New Email Topic. If you choose Create New Email Topic, you can set the name and email addresses for a new topic. This list will be saved and appear in the drop-down box for future alarms. Choose Continue. \nNoteIf you use Create New Email Topic to create a new Amazon SNS topic, the email addresses must be verified before they will receive notifications. Emails are sent only when the alarm enters an alarm state. If this alarm state change happens before the email addresses are verified, they will not receive a notification. At this point, the Create Alarm wizard gives you a chance to review the alarm you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re about to create. If you need to make any changes, you can use the Edit links on the right. Once you are satisfied, choose Create Alarm.",

For example, if you've previously registered with The Campaign Registry, they might already have your information. However, some campaigns might take one week or longer for approval. After your company and 10DLC campaign are approved, you can purchase a 10DLC number and associate it with your campaign. Requesting a 10DLC might also take up to a week for approval.

You publish a message from an Amazon EC2 instance that's hosted in Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC). The message stays within the AWS network without traveling the public internet. By publishing messages privately from a VPC, you can improve the security of the traffic between your applications and Amazon SNS. This security is important when you publish personally identifiable information (PII) about your customers, or when your application is subject to market regulations. For example, publishing privately is helpful if you have a healthcare system that must comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), or a financial system that must comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).",
