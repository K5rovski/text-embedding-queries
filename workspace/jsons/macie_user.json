"text": "Automate the discovery of sensitive data\n\nWith Macie, you can automate discovery and reporting of sensitive data by creating and running sensitive data discovery jobs. A sensitive data discovery job analyzes objects in S3 buckets to determine whether they contain sensitive data. If Macie detects sensitive data in an object, it creates a sensitive data finding for you. The finding provides a detailed report of the sensitive data that Macie found.\nYou can configure a job to run only once, for on-demand analysis and assessment, or on a recurring basis for periodic analysis, assessment, and monitoring. You can also choose various options to control the breadth and depth of a job's analysis\u00e2\u0080\u0094the S3 buckets to analyze, the sampling depth, and custom include and exclude criteria that derive from properties of S3 objects. With these scheduling and scope options, you can build and maintain a comprehensive view of the data that your organization stores in Amazon S3 and any security or compliance risks for that data.\n\nDiscover a variety of sensitive data types\n\nWhen you create a sensitive data discovery job, you can configure the job to use built-in criteria and techniques, such as machine learning and pattern matching, to analyze objects in S3 buckets. These criteria and techniques, referred to as managed data identifiers, can detect a large and growing list of sensitive data types for many countries and regions, including multiple types of personally identifiable information (PII), personal health information (PHI), and financial data.\nYou can also configure the job to use custom data identifiers. A custom data identifier is a set of criteria that you define to detect sensitive data\u00e2\u0080\u0094a regular expression (regex) that defines a text pattern to match and, optionally, character sequences and a proximity rule that refine the results. With this type of identifier, you can detect sensitive data that reflects your particular scenarios, intellectual property, or proprietary data, and supplement the managed data identifiers that Macie provides.\n\nEvaluate and monitor data for security and access control\n\nWhen you enable Macie, Macie immediately generates and begins maintaining a complete inventory of your S3 buckets, and it begins evaluating and monitoring the buckets for security and access control. If Macie detects a potential issue with the security or privacy of a bucket, it creates a policy finding for you.\nIn addition to specific findings, a dashboard gives you a snapshot of aggregated statistics for your buckets. This includes statistics that indicate how many of your buckets are publicly accessible, are shared with other AWS accounts, or don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t encrypt objects by default. You can drill down on each statistic to view the supporting data.\nMacie also provides detailed information and statistics for individual buckets in your inventory. This data includes breakdowns of a bucket\u00e2\u0080\u0099s public access and encryption settings, and the size and number of objects that Macie can analyze to detect sensitive data in the bucket. You can browse the inventory, or sort and filter the inventory by certain fields. When you choose a bucket, a panel displays the bucket\u00e2\u0080\u0099s details.\n\nReview and analyze findings\n\nIn Macie, a finding is a detailed report of sensitive data in an S3 object or a potential policy-related issue with the security or privacy of an S3 bucket. Each finding provides a severity rating, information about the affected resource, and additional details, such as when and how Macie found the issue.\nTo review, analyze, and manage findings, you can use the Findings pages on the Amazon Macie console. These pages list your findings and provide the details of individual findings. They also provide multiple options for grouping, filtering, sorting, and suppressing findings. You can also use the Amazon Macie API to query, retrieve, and suppress findings. If you use the API, you can pass the data to another application, service, or system for deeper analysis, long-term storage, or reporting.\n\nMonitor and process findings with other services and systems\n\nTo support integration with other services and systems, Macie publishes findings to Amazon EventBridge as finding events. EventBridge is a serverless event bus service that can route findings data to targets such as AWS Lambda functions and Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topics. With EventBridge, you can monitor and process findings in near-real time as part of your existing security and compliance workflows.\nYou can configure Macie to also publish findings to AWS Security Hub. Security Hub is a service that provides a comprehensive view of your security posture across your AWS environment and helps you check your environment against security industry standards and best practices. With Security Hub, you can more easily monitor and process your findings as part of a broader analysis of your organization's security posture in AWS.\n\nCentrally manage multiple Macie accounts\n\nIf your AWS environment has multiple accounts, you can centrally manage Macie for accounts in your environment. You can do this in two ways, by integrating Macie with AWS Organizations or by sending membership invitations from Macie.\nIn a multiple-account configuration, a designated Macie administrator can perform certain tasks and access certain Macie settings, data, and resources for accounts that are members of the same organization. Tasks include reviewing information about S3 buckets that are owned by member accounts, reviewing policy findings for those buckets, and running sensitive data discovery jobs to detect sensitive data in the buckets. If the accounts are associated through AWS Organizations, the Macie administrator can also enable Macie for member accounts in the organization.\n\nDevelop and manage resources programmatically\n\nIn addition to the Amazon Macie console, you can interact with Macie by using the Amazon Macie API. The Amazon Macie API gives you comprehensive, programmatic access to your Macie account and resources.\nTo develop and manage resources with the Amazon Macie API, you can send HTTPS requests directly to Macie or use a current version of an AWS command line tool or an AWS SDK. AWS provides tools and SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various languages and platforms, such as PowerShell, Java, Go, Python, C++, and .NET.",

Using the command line can be faster and more convenient than using the console. The command line tools are also useful if you want to build scripts that perform tasks.\nAWS provides two sets of command line tools: the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) and the AWS Tools for PowerShell. For information about installing and using the AWS CLI, see the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide. For information about installing and using the Tools for PowerShell, see the AWS Tools for PowerShell User Guide.\n\nAWS SDKs\n\nAWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example, Java, Go, Python, C++, and .NET. The SDKs provide convenient, programmatic access to Macie and other AWS services. They also handle tasks such as cryptographically signing requests, managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For information about installing and using the AWS SDKs, see Tools to Build on AWS.\n\nAmazon Macie REST API\n\nThe Amazon Macie REST API gives you comprehensive, programmatic access to your Macie account and resources. With this API, you can send HTTPS requests directly to Macie. However, unlike the AWS command line tools and SDKs, use of this API requires your application to handle low-level details such as generating a hash to sign a request.

"text": "Gathering metadata and calculating statistics\n\nTo generate and maintain metadata and statistics for your bucket inventory, Macie retrieves bucket and object metadata directly from Amazon S3. For each bucket, the metadata includes: General information about the bucket, such as the bucket\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name, Amazon Resource Name (ARN), creation date, default encryption settings, tags, and the account ID for the AWS account that owns the bucket.\n\nAccount-level permissions settings that apply to the bucket, such as the block public access setting for the account.\n\nBucket-level permissions settings for the bucket, such as the block public access setting for the bucket and settings that derive from a bucket policy or access control list (ACL).\n\nShared access and replication settings for the bucket, including whether bucket data is replicated to or shared with AWS accounts that aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t part of your organization.\n\nObject counts and settings for objects in the bucket, such as the number of objects in the bucket and breakdowns of object counts by encryption type, file type, and storage class.\n\nMacie provides this information to you directly. Macie also uses the information to calculate statistics and provide assessments about the security and privacy of your bucket inventory overall and individual buckets in your inventory. For example, you can find the total storage size and number of buckets in your inventory, the total storage size and number of objects in those buckets, and the total storage size and number of objects that Macie can analyze to detect sensitive data in the buckets.\n\nMonitoring bucket security and privacy\n\nTo help ensure the accuracy of bucket-level data in your inventory, Macie monitors and analyzes certain AWS CloudTrail events that can occur for Amazon S3 data. If a relevant event occurs, Macie updates the appropriate inventory data.\nFor example, if you enable default encryption for a bucket, Macie updates all data about the bucket\u00e2\u0080\u0099s default encryption settings. Similarly, if you update an existing bucket policy or add a policy to a bucket, Macie analyzes the policy and updates the relevant data in your inventory.\nMacie monitors and analyzes data for the following CloudTrail events: Account-level events \u00e2\u0080\u0093 DeletePublicAccessBlock and PutPublicAccessBlock\n\nBucket-level events \u00e2\u0080\u0093 CreateBucket, DeleteAccountPublicAccessBlock, DeleteBucket, DeleteBucketEncryption, DeleteBucketPolicy, DeleteBucketPublicAccessBlock, DeleteBucketReplication, DeleteBucketTagging, PutAccountPublicAccessBlock, PutBucketAcl, PutBucketEncryption, PutBucketPolicy, PutBucketPublicAccessBlock, PutBucketReplication, PutBucketTagging, and PutBucketVersioning\n\nYou can't enable monitoring for additional CloudTrail events or disable monitoring for any of the preceding events. For detailed information about corresponding operations for the preceding events, see the Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference.\nTipTo monitor object-level events, we recommend that you use the Amazon S3 protection feature of Amazon GuardDuty. This feature monitors object-level, Amazon S3 data events and analyzes them for malicious and suspicious activity. For more information, see Amazon S3 protection in Amazon GuardDuty in the Amazon GuardDuty User Guide.\n\nEvaluating bucket security and access control\n\nTo evaluate bucket-level security and access control, Macie uses automated, logic-based reasoning to analyze resource-based policies that apply to a bucket. Macie also analyzes the account- and bucket-level permissions settings that apply to a bucket. This analysis factors bucket policies, bucket-level ACLs, and block public access settings for the account and the bucket.\nFor resource-based policies, Macie uses Zelkova. Zelkova is an automated reasoning engine that translates IAM policies into logical statements and runs a suite of general-purpose and specialized logical solvers (satisfiability modulo theories) against the decision problem. Macie applies Zelkova repeatedly to a policy with increasingly specific queries to characterize the classes of behaviors that the policy allows. To learn more about the nature of the solvers that Zelkova uses, see Satisfiability Modulo Theories.",

"text": "Inventory data applies only to S3 buckets in the current AWS Region. To access the data for additional Regions, enable and use Macie in each additional Region.\n\nIf you're the Macie administrator for an organization, you can access inventory data for a member account only if Macie is enabled for that account in the current Region.\n\nIf a bucket's permissions settings prevent Macie from retrieving information about the bucket or the bucket\u00e2\u0080\u0099s objects, Macie can't evaluate and monitor the security and privacy of the bucket's data or provide detailed information about the bucket.\nTo help you identify a bucket where this is the case, Macie does the following: In your bucket inventory, Macie displays a warning icon (\n\n) for the bucket. For the bucket's details, Macie displays only a subset of fields and data: the account ID for the AWS account that owns the bucket; the bucket's name, Amazon Resource Name (ARN), creation date, and Region; and, the date and time when Macie most recently retrieved both bucket and object metadata for the bucket as part of the daily refresh cycle. If you use the Amazon Macie API to query inventory data, Macie provides an error code and message for the bucket and the value for most of the bucket's properties is null. On the Summary dashboard, the bucket has a value of Unknown for the Public access, Encryption, and Sharing statistics. (If you use the Amazon Macie API to query the statistics, the bucket has a value of unknown for these statistics.) In addition, Macie excludes the bucket when it calculates data for Storage and Objects statistics.\n\nTo investigate the issue, review the bucket\u00e2\u0080\u0099s policy and permissions settings in Amazon S3. For example, the bucket might have a restrictive bucket policy. For more information, see Allowing Macie to access S3 buckets and objects.\n\nData about access and permissions is limited to account- and bucket-level settings. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t reflect object-level settings that determine access to specific objects in a bucket. For example, if public access is enabled for a specific object in a bucket, Macie doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t report that the bucket or the bucket\u00e2\u0080\u0099s objects are publicly accessible.\nTo monitor object-level operations and identify potential security risks, we recommend that you use the Amazon S3 protection feature of Amazon GuardDuty. This feature monitors object-level, Amazon S3 data events and analyzes them for malicious and suspicious activity. For more information, see Amazon S3 protection in Amazon GuardDuty in the Amazon GuardDuty User Guide.\n\nIf you manually refresh object metadata for a specific bucket, Macie temporarily reports Unknown for encryption statistics that apply to the objects. The next time Macie performs the daily data refresh (within 24 hours), Macie re-evaluates the encryption metadata for the objects and reports quantitative data for the statistics again.\n\nIn rare cases, Macie might not be able to determine whether a bucket is publicly accessible, is shared with another AWS account, or requires server-side encryption of new objects. For example, a temporary issue might prevent Macie from retrieving and analyzing the requisite data. Or Macie might not be able to fully determine whether one or more policy statements grant access to an external entity. In these cases, Macie reports Unknown for the relevant statistics and fields in the inventory. To investigate these cases, review the bucket\u00e2\u0080\u0099s policy and permissions settings in Amazon S3.",

"text": "1. Storage and sensitive data discovery The statistics at the top of the S3 buckets section indicate how much data you store in Amazon S3 and how much of that data Macie can analyze to detect sensitive data: Total S3 buckets \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The total number of S3 buckets, including buckets that don't contain any objects.\n\nStorage Classifiable \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The total storage size of all the objects that Macie can analyze in the buckets.\n\nTotal \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The total storage size of all the objects in the buckets, including objects that Macie can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t analyze.\n\nIf any of the objects are compressed files, these values don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t reflect the actual size of those files after they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re decompressed. If versioning is enabled for any of the buckets, these values are based on the storage size of the latest version of each object in those buckets.\n\nObjects Classifiable \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The total number of objects that Macie can analyze in the buckets.\n\nTotal \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The total number of objects in the buckets, including objects that Macie can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t analyze. In the preceding statistics, data and objects are classifiable if they use a supported Amazon S3 storage class (S3 Intelligent-Tiering, S3 One Zone-IA, S3 Standard, or S3 Standard-IA) and have a file name extension for a supported file or storage format. You can detect sensitive data in these objects by creating and running sensitive data discovery jobs.\nNote that the Storage and Objects statistics don't include data about objects in buckets that Macie isn't allowed to access. To identify buckets where this is the case, you can review your bucket inventory. If the warning icon (\n\n) appears next to a bucket's name in your inventory, Macie isn't allowed to access the bucket.\n\n2. Public access\n\nThis section indicates how many S3 buckets are or aren't publicly accessible: Publicly accessible \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The number and percentage of buckets that allow the general public to have read or write access to the bucket.\n\nPublicly world writable \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The number and percentage of buckets that allow the general public to have write access to the bucket.\n\nPublicly world readable \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The number and percentage of buckets that allow the general public to have read access to the bucket.\n\nNot publicly accessible \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The number and percentage of buckets that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t allow the general public to have read or write access to the bucket.\n\nTo calculate each percentage, Macie divides the number of applicable buckets by the total number of buckets in your bucket inventory. \nTo determine the values in this section, Macie analyzes a combination of account- and bucket-level settings for each bucket: the block public access setting for the account; the block public access setting for the bucket; the bucket policy for the bucket; and, the access control list (ACL) for the bucket. For information about these settings, see Identity and access management in Amazon S3 and Blocking public access to your Amazon S3 storage in the Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide.\nIn certain cases, this section also displays values for Unknown. If these values appear, Macie wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t able to evaluate the public access settings for the specified number and percentage of buckets. For example, a temporary issue or the buckets' permissions settings prevented Macie from retrieving the requisite data. Or Macie wasn't able to fully determine whether one or more policy statements allow an external entity to access the buckets. 3. Encryption\n\nThis section indicates how many S3 buckets are or aren't configured to encrypt new objects automatically, and how many S3 buckets do or don't require server-side encryption of objects when objects are uploaded to the buckets: Default encryption disabled \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The number and percentage of buckets that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t encrypt new objects automatically. Default encryption is disabled for these buckets.\n\nNot required by bucket policy \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The number and percentage of buckets whose bucket policies don't require server-side encryption of new objects. For these buckets, PutObject requests don't have to specify a valid, server-side encryption option.\n\nEncrypt by default \u00e2\u0080\u0093 SSE-S3 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The number and percentage of buckets that encrypt new objects automatically using an Amazon S3 managed key. Default encryption is enabled for these buckets.\n\nEncrypt by default \u00e2\u0080\u0093 SSE-KMS \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The number and percentage of buckets that encrypt new objects automatically using an AWS KMS key. Default encryption is enabled for these buckets.\n\nRequired by bucket policy \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The number and percentage of buckets whose bucket policies require server-side encryption of new objects. For these buckets, PutObject requests must specify a valid, server-side encryption option. Otherwise, Amazon S3 denies the request.\n\nNote that the totals in this section might exceed the total number of buckets in your inventory. This is because a bucket can have a combination of encryption settings. For example, a bucket might not be configured to encrypt new objects automatically and it might not have a bucket policy that requires server-side encryption of new objects.\nTo calculate each percentage in this section, Macie divides the number of applicable buckets by the total number of buckets in your bucket inventory.\nTo determine the values in this section, Macie analyzes the default encryption settings and, if applicable, the bucket policy for each bucket. For information about default encryption settings, see Setting default server-side encryption behavior for Amazon S3 buckets in the Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide. For information about using bucket policies to require sever-side encryption of new objects, see How to prevent uploads of unencrypted objects to Amazon S3 on the AWS Security Blog.\nIn certain cases, this section also displays values for Unknown. If these values appear, Macie wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t able to evaluate the default encryption settings or bucket policy for the specified number and percentage of buckets. For example, a temporary issue or the buckets' permissions settings prevented Macie from retrieving the requisite data. Or Macie wasn't able to fully determine whether the buckets' policies require server-side encryption of new objects.\n\n4. Sharing\n\nThis section indicates how many S3 buckets are or aren't shared with other AWS accounts: Shared outside \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The number and percentage of buckets that are shared with accounts that aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t in the same organization.\n\nShared inside \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The number and percentage of buckets that are shared with accounts in the same organization.\n\nNot shared \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The number and percentage of buckets that aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t shared with other accounts.\n\nTo calculate each percentage, Macie divides the number of applicable buckets by the total number of buckets in your bucket inventory.\nTo determine the values in this section, Macie analyzes the bucket policy and ACL for each bucket. In addition, an organization is defined as a set of Macie accounts that are centrally managed as a group of related accounts through AWS Organizations or by Macie invitation.\nIn certain cases, this section also displays values for Unknown. If these values appear, Macie wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t able to determine whether the specified number and percentage of buckets are shared with another account. For example, a temporary issue or the buckets' permissions settings prevented Macie from retrieving the requisite data. Or Macie wasn't able to fully determine whether the buckets' policies or ACLs are configured to share the buckets with another account.",

"text": "To view your S3 bucket inventoryOpen the Macie console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/macie/.\nIn the navigation pane, choose S3 buckets. The S3 buckets page opens and displays the number of buckets in your inventory and a table of the buckets.\n\nAt the top of the page, optionally choose refresh (\n\n) to retrieve the latest bucket metadata from Amazon S3.\nIf the information icon (\n\n) appears next to any bucket names, we recommend that you do this. This icon indicates that a bucket was created during the past 24 hours, possibly after Macie last retrieved bucket and object metadata from Amazon S3 as part of the daily refresh cycle.\n\nOn the S3 buckets page, use the table to review a subset of information about each bucket in your inventory: Bucket \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The name of the bucket.\n\nAccount \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The account ID for the AWS account that owns the bucket.\n\nClassifiable objects \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The total number of objects that Macie can analyze to detect sensitive data in the bucket.\n\nClassifiable size \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The total storage size of all the objects that Macie can analyze to detect sensitive data in the bucket.\nNote that this value doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t reflect the actual size of any compressed objects after they're decompressed. Also, if versioning is enabled for the bucket, this value is based on the storage size of the latest version of each object in the bucket.\n\nMonitored \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Whether any sensitive data discovery jobs are configured to periodically analyze objects in the bucket on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.\nIf the value for this field is Yes, the bucket is explicitly included in a periodic job or the bucket matched the criteria for a periodic job within the past 24 hours. In addition, the status of at least one of those jobs is not Cancelled. Macie updates this data on a daily basis.\n\nLatest job run \u00e2\u0080\u0093 If any one-time or periodic sensitive data discovery jobs are configured to analyze objects in the bucket, the value for this field indicates the most recent time when one of those jobs started to run. Otherwise, this field is empty. In the preceding data, objects are classifiable if they use a supported Amazon S3 storage class and have a file name extension for a supported file or storage format. You can detect sensitive data in these objects by creating and running a sensitive data discovery job: select the check box for each bucket that contains objects to analyze, and then choose Create job. For more information, see Discovering sensitive data.\n\nTo analyze your inventory by using the table, do any of the following: To sort the table by a specific field, click the column heading for the field. To change the sort order, click the column heading again.\n\nTo filter the table and display only those buckets that have a specific value for a field, place your cursor in the filter bar, and then add a filter condition for the field. To further refine the results, add filter conditions for additional fields. For more information, see Filtering your S3 bucket inventory. To review details and statistics for a particular bucket, choose the bucket's name in the table, and then refer to the details panel.\nTipYou can pivot and drill down on many of the fields in the details panel. To show buckets that have the same value for a field, choose in the field. To show buckets that have other values for a field, choose in the field.",

"text": "To filter your inventory by using the consoleOpen the Macie console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/macie/.\nIn the navigation pane, choose S3 buckets. The S3 buckets page opens and displays the number of buckets in your inventory and a table of the buckets.\n\nTo retrieve the latest bucket metadata from Amazon S3, choose refresh (\n\n) at the top of the page.\n\nPlace your cursor in the filter bar, and then choose the field to use for the condition. Choose or enter the appropriate type of value for the field, keeping the following tips in mind. Dates, times, and time ranges\n\nFor dates and times, use the From and To boxes to define an inclusive time range: To define a fixed time range, use the From and To boxes to specify the first date and time and the last date and time in the range, respectively.\n\nTo define a relative time range that starts at a certain date and time and ends at the current time, enter the start date and time in the From boxes, and delete any text in To boxes.\n\nTo define a relative time range that ends at a certain date and time, enter the end date and time in the To boxes, and delete any text in the From boxes.\n\nNote that time values use 24-hour notation. If you use the date picker to choose dates, you can refine the values by entering text directly in the From and To boxes.\n\nNumbers and numeric ranges\n\nFor numeric values, use the From and To boxes to enter integers that define an inclusive numeric range: To define a fixed numeric range, use the From and To boxes to specify the lowest and highest numbers in the range, respectively. To define a fixed numeric range that's limited to one specific value, enter the value in both the From and To boxes. For example, to include only those buckets that contain exactly 15 objects, enter 15 in the From and To boxes.\n\nTo define a relative numeric range that starts at a certain number, enter the number in the From box, and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t enter any text in the To box.\n\nTo define a relative numeric range that ends at a certain number, enter the number in the To box, and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t enter any text in the From box. Text (string) values\n\nFor this type of value, enter a complete, valid value for the field. Values are case sensitive.\nNote that you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t use a partial value or wildcard characters in this type of value. The only exception is the Bucket name field. For that field, you can specify a prefix instead of a complete bucket name. For example, to find all S3 buckets whose names begin with my-S3, enter my-S3 as the filter value for Bucket name field. If you enter any other value, such as My-s3 or my*, Macie won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t return the buckets. When you finish adding a value for the field, choose Apply. Macie applies the filter criteria and adds the condition to a filter box in the filter bar.\nTipFor many fields, you can change a condition's operator from equals to not equals by choosing the equals icon (\n\n) in the filter box. If you do this, Macie changes the operator to not equals and displays the not equals icon (\n\n) in the filter box. To switch to the equals operator again, choose the not equals icon.\n\nRepeat steps 4 through 6 for each additional condition that you want to add.\n\nTo remove a condition, choose the remove condition icon (\n\n) in the filter box for the condition.\n\nTo change a condition, remove the condition by choosing the remove condition icon (\n\n) in the filter box for the condition. Then repeat steps 4 through 6 to add a condition with the correct settings.",

"text": "Structured, columnar data\n\nFor columnar data, a keyword has to be part of the same value or in the name of the column or field that stores a value. This is true for Microsoft Excel workbooks, CSV files, and TSV files.\nFor example, if the value for a field contains both SSN and a nine-digit number that uses the syntax of a US Social Security number (SSN), Macie can detect the SSN in the field. Similarly, if the name of a column contains SSN, Macie can detect each SSN in the column. Macie treats the values in that column as being in proximity of the keyword SSN.\n\nStructured, record-based data\n\nFor record-based data, a keyword has to be part of the same value or in the name of an element in the path to the field or array that stores a value. This is true for Apache Avro object containers, Apache Parquet files, JSON files, and JSON Lines files.\nFor example, if the value for a field contains both credentials and a character sequence that uses the syntax of an AWS secret access key, Macie can detect the key in the field. Similarly, if the path to a field is $.credentials.aws.key, Macie can detect an AWS secret access key in the field. Macie treats the value in the field as being in proximity of the keyword credentials.\n\nUnstructured data\n\nFor Adobe Portable Document Format files, Microsoft Word documents, and non-binary text files other than CSV, JSON, JSON Lines, and TSV files, there aren't any additional proximity requirements. A keyword typically has to be within 30 characters (inclusively) of the data. This includes any structured data, such as tables, in these types of files.",

"text": "Keywords\n\nThese are specific character sequences that must be in proximity of text that matches the regex pattern. The proximity requirements vary based on an S3 object's storage format or file type: For structured, columnar data, Macie reports text that matches the regex pattern if a keyword is in the name of the field or column that stores the text, or the text is preceded by and within the maximum match distance of a keyword in the same field or cell value. This is true for Microsoft Excel workbooks, CSV files, and TSV files.\n\nFor structured, record-based data, Macie reports text that matches the regex pattern if the text is within the maximum match distance of a keyword. The keyword can be in the name of an element in the path to the field or array that stores the text, or it can precede and be part of the same value in the field or array that stores the text. This is true for Apache Avro object containers, Apache Parquet files, JSON files, and JSON Lines files.\n\nFor unstructured data, Macie reports text that matches the regex pattern if the text is preceded by and within the maximum match distance of a keyword. This is true for Adobe Portable Document Format files, Microsoft Word documents, and non-binary text files other than CSV, JSON, JSON Lines, and TSV files. This includes any structured data, such as tables, in these types of files.\n\nYou can specify as many as 50 keywords. Each keyword can contain 3\u00e2\u0080\u009390 UTF-8 characters. Keywords aren't case sensitive.\n\nMaximum match distance\n\nThis is a character-based proximity rule for keywords. Macie uses this setting to determine whether a keyword precedes text that matches the regex pattern. The setting defines the maximum number of characters that can exist between the end of a complete keyword and the end of text that matches the regex pattern. If text matches the regex pattern, occurs after at least one complete keyword, and occurs within the specified distance of the keyword, Macie reports the text. Otherwise, Macie doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t report the text.\nYou can specify a distance of 1\u00e2\u0080\u0093300 characters. The default distance is 50 characters. For best results, this distance should be greater than the minimum number of characters in text that the regex is designed to detect. If only part of the text is within the maximum match distance of a keyword, Macie doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t report that occurrence of the text.\n\nIgnore words\n\nThese are specific character sequences to exclude from the results. If text matches the regex pattern and it contains an ignore word, Macie doesn't report that occurrence of the text.\nYou can specify as many as 10 ignore words. Each ignore word can contain 4\u00e2\u0080\u009390 UTF-8 characters. Ignore words are case sensitive.",

"text": "To create a custom data identifierOpen the Amazon Macie console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/macie/.\nIn the navigation pane, under Settings, choose Custom data identifiers.\n\nChoose Create.\n\nFor Name, enter a name for the custom data identifier. The name can contain as many as 128 characters.\nAvoid including any sensitive data in the name. Other users of your account might be able to see the name, depending on the actions that they're allowed to perform in Macie.\n\n(Optional) For Description, enter a brief description of the custom data identifier. The description can contain as many as 512 characters.\nAvoid including any sensitive data in the description. Other users of your account might be able to see the description, depending on the actions that they're allowed to perform in Macie.\n\nFor Regular expression, enter the regular expression (regex) that defines the text pattern to match. The regex can contain as many as 512 characters. To learn about supported syntax and constraints, see Regex support later in this section.\n\n(Optional) For Keywords, enter as many as 50 character sequences (separated by commas) to define specific text that must be in proximity of text that matches the regex pattern. Each keyword can contain 3\u00e2\u0080\u009390 UTF-8 characters. Keywords aren't case sensitive.\nMacie includes an occurrence only if the text matches the regex pattern and is within the maximum match distance of one of these keywords, as explained in the preceding topic.\n\n(Optional) For Ignore words, enter as many as 10 character sequences (separated by commas) that define specific text to exclude from the results. Each ignore word can contain 4\u00e2\u0080\u009390 UTF-8 characters. Ignore words are case sensitive.\nMacie excludes occurrences of text that contains any of these words, even if the text matches the regex pattern. In other words, if text matches the regex pattern but it contains one of these character sequences, Macie ignores the occurrence.\n\n(Optional) For Maximum match distance, enter the maximum number of characters that can exist between the end of a complete keyword and the end of text that matches the regex pattern. The distance can be 1\u00e2\u0080\u0093300 characters. The default distance is 50 characters.\nMacie includes an occurrence only if the text matches the regex pattern and is within this distance of a complete keyword, as explained in the preceding topic.\n\nFor Severity, choose how you want Macie to assign severity to sensitive data findings that the custom data identifier produces: To automatically assign the Medium severity to all findings, choose Use Medium severity for any number of matches (default). With this option, Macie creates a Medium severity finding for each S3 object that contains at least one occurrence of text that matches the detection criteria.\n\nTo assign severity based on custom occurrences thresholds that you specify, choose Use custom settings to determine severity. Then use the Occurrences threshold and Severity level options to specify the minimum number of matches that must exist in an S3 object to produce a finding with a selected severity.\nFor example, to assign the High severity to a finding that reports 100 or more occurrences of text that matches the identifier's detection criteria, enter 100 in the Occurrences threshold box and then choose High from the Severity level list.\nYou can specify as many as three occurrences thresholds, one for each severity level that Macie supports: Low (for least severe), Medium, or High (for most severe). If you specify more than one, the thresholds must be in ascending order by severity, moving from Low to High. If an S3 object contains fewer occurrences than the lowest specified threshold, Macie won't create a finding. (Optional) For Tags, choose Add tag, and then enter as many as 50 tags to assign to the custom data identifier.\nA\u00c2\u00a0tag\u00c2\u00a0is a label that you define and assign to certain types of AWS resources. Each tag consists of a required tag key and an optional tag value. Tags can help you identify, categorize, and manage resources in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria. To learn more, see Tagging Amazon Macie resources.\n\n(Optional) For Evaluate, enter up to 1,000 characters in the Sample data box, and then choose Test to test the custom data identifier's detection criteria. Macie evaluates the sample data and reports the number of occurrences of text that matches the criteria. You can repeat this step as many times as you like to refine and optimize the criteria.\nNoteWe strongly recommend that you test and refine the detection criteria before you save the custom data identifier. Because custom data identifiers are used by sensitive data discovery jobs, you can't edit a custom data identifier after you save it. This helps ensure that you have an immutable history of sensitive data findings and discovery results for data privacy and protection audits or investigations that you perform.\n\nWhen you finish, choose Submit.",

It gives you precise, predictable control over which buckets a job analyzes.\n\nSpecifying bucket criteria\n\nWith this option, you define runtime criteria that determine which S3 buckets the job analyzes. The criteria consist of one or more conditions that derive from bucket properties, such as public access settings and tags. When the job runs, it identifies buckets that match your criteria and then analyzes objects in those buckets. If you also configure the job to run periodically, the job does this each time it runs. Consequently, the job might analyze objects in different buckets each time it runs, depending on changes to your bucket inventory and the criteria that you define.\nThis configuration is helpful for cases where you want the scope of the job's analysis to dynamically adapt to changes to your bucket inventory. For example, if you configure a job to use bucket criteria and run periodically, the job can automatically identify new buckets that match the criteria and inspect those buckets for sensitive data.",

"text": "File name extension\n\nThis correlates to the file name extension of an S3 object. You can use this type of condition to include or exclude objects based on file type. To do this for multiple types of files, enter the file name extension for each type and separate each entry with a comma\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example: docx,pdf,xlsx. If you enter multiple file name extensions as values for a condition, Macie uses OR logic to join the values.\nNote that values are case sensitive. In addition, Macie doesn't support the use of partial values or wildcard characters in this type of condition.\nFor information about the types of files that Macie can analyze, see Supported file and storage formats.\n\nLast modified\n\nThis correlates to the Last modified field in Amazon S3. In Amazon S3, this field stores the date and time when an S3 object was created or last changed, whichever is latest.\nFor a sensitive data discovery job, this condition can be a specific date, a specific date and time, or an exclusive time range: To analyze objects that were last modified after a certain date or date and time, enter the values in the From fields.\n\nTo analyze objects that were last modified before a certain date or date and time, enter the values in the To fields.\n\nTo analyze objects that were last modified during a certain time range, use the From fields to enter the values for the first date or date and time in the time range. Use the To fields to enter the values for the last date or date and time in the time range.\n\nTo analyze objects that were last modified at any time during a certain single day, enter the date in the From date field. Enter the date for the next day in the To date field. Then verify that both time fields are blank. (Macie treats a blank time field as 00:00:00.) For example, to analyze objects that changed on August 9, 2020, enter 2020/08/09 in the From date field, enter 2020/08/10 in the To date field, and don't enter a value in either time field.\n\nEnter any time values in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and use 24-hour notation.\n\nPrefix\n\nThis correlates to the Key field in Amazon S3. In Amazon S3, this field stores the name of an S3 object, including the object's prefix. A prefix is similar to a directory path within a bucket. It enables you to group similar objects together in a bucket, much like you might store similar files together in a folder on a file system. For information about object prefixes and folders in Amazon S3, see Organizing objects in the Amazon S3 console using folders in the Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide.\nYou can use this type of condition to include or exclude objects whose keys (names) begin with a certain value. For example, to exclude all objects whose key begins with AWSLogs, enter AWSLogs as the value for a Prefix condition, and then choose Exclude. \nIf you enter multiple prefixes as values for a condition, Macie uses OR logic to join the values. For example, if you enter AWSLogs1 and AWSLogs2 as values for a condition, any object whose key begins with AWSLogs1 or AWSLogs2 meets the condition\u00e2\u0080\u0099s criteria.\nWhen you enter a value for a Prefix condition, keep the following in mind: Values are case sensitive.\n\nMacie doesn't support the use of wildcard characters in these values.\n\nIn Amazon S3, an object\u00e2\u0080\u0099s key doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t include the name of the bucket that contains the object. For this reason, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t specify bucket names in these values.\n\nIf a prefix includes a delimiter, include the delimiter in the value. For example, enter AWSLogs/eventlogs to define a condition for all objects whose key begins with AWSLogs/eventlogs. Macie supports the default Amazon S3 delimiter, which is a slash (/), and custom delimiters.\n\nAlso note that an object meets a condition's criteria only if the object's key exactly matches the value that you enter, starting with the first character in the object's key. In addition, Macie applies a condition to the complete Key value for an object, including the object's file name. \nFor example, if an object's key is AWSLogs/eventlogs/testlog.csv and you enter any of the following values for a condition, the object meets the condition's criteria: AWSLogs\n\nAWSLogs/event\n\nAWSLogs/eventlogs/\n\nAWSLogs/eventlogs/testlog\n\nAWSLogs/eventlogs/testlog.csv\n\nHowever, if you enter eventlogs, the object doesn't meet the criteria\u00e2\u0080\u0094the condition's value doesn't include the first part of the key, AWSLogs/. Similarly, if you enter awslogs, the object doesn't meet the criteria due to differences in capitalization.\n\nStorage size\n\nThis correlates to the Size field in Amazon S3. In Amazon S3, this field indicates the total storage size of an S3 object. If an object is a compressed file, this value doesn't reflect the actual size of the file after it's decompressed.\nYou can use this type of condition to include or exclude objects that are smaller than a certain size, larger than a certain size, or fall within a certain size range. Macie applies this type of condition to all types of objects, including compressed or archive files and the files that they contain. For information about size-based restrictions for each supported format, see Amazon Macie quotas.\n\nTags\n\nThe tags that are associated with an S3 object. Tags are labels that you can define and assign to certain types of AWS resources, including S3 objects. Each tag consists of a required tag key and an optional tag value. For information about tagging S3 objects, see Categorizing your storage using tags in the Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide.\nFor a sensitive data discovery job, you can use this type of condition to include or exclude objects that have a specific tag. This can be a specific tag key or a specific tag key and tag value (as a pair). If you specify multiple tags as values for a condition, Macie uses OR logic to join the values. For example, if you specify Project1 and Project2 as tag keys for a condition, any object that has the Project1 or Project2 tag key meets the condition\u00e2\u0080\u0099s criteria.\nNote that tag keys and values are case sensitive. In addition, Macie doesn't support use of partial values or wildcard characters in this type of condition.",

"text": "If you choose to explicitly select each S3 bucket that you want the job to analyze, Macie provides you with a complete inventory of your buckets in the current AWS Region. You can then use this inventory to select one or more buckets for the job to analyze. To learn about this inventory, see Selecting S3 buckets.If you're the Macie administrator for an organization, the inventory includes buckets that are owned by member accounts in your organization. You can configure the job to analyze objects in as many as 1,000 of these buckets, spanning as many as 1,000 accounts.To select specific buckets for the jobOpen the Macie console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/macie/.\nIn the navigation pane, choose Jobs.\n\nChoose Create job.\n\nOn the Choose S3 buckets page, choose Select specific buckets. Macie displays a table of all the buckets for your account in the current Region. Under Select S3 buckets, optionally choose refresh (\n\n) to retrieve the latest bucket metadata from Amazon S3.\nIf the information icon (\n\n) appears next to any bucket names, we recommend that you do this. This icon indicates that a bucket was created during the past 24 hours, possibly after Macie last retrieved bucket and object metadata from Amazon S3 as part of the daily refresh cycle.\n\nIn the table, select the check box for each bucket that you want the job to analyze. \nTip\n\nTo find specific buckets more easily, enter filter criteria in the filter bar above the table. You can also sort the table by choosing a column heading.\n\nTo quickly determine whether you already configured a job to periodically analyze objects in a bucket, refer to the Monitored column. If Yes appears in the column, the bucket is explicitly included in a periodic job or the bucket matched the criteria for a periodic job within the past 24 hours. In addition, the status of at least one of those jobs is not Cancelled. Macie updates this data on a daily basis. To quickly determine when you most recently ran a periodic or one-time job to analyze objects in a bucket, refer to the Latest job run column. For additional information about that job, refer to the bucket's details.\n\nTo display a bucket's details, choose the bucket's name. In addition to job-related information, the details panel provides statistics and other information about the bucket, such as the bucket's public access settings. To learn more about this data, see Reviewing your S3 bucket inventory. When you finish selecting buckets, choose Next.\nIn the next step, you'll review and verify your selections.If you choose to specify runtime criteria that determine which S3 buckets the job analyzes, Macie provides options to help you choose fields, operators, and values for individual conditions in the criteria. To learn more about these options, see Specifying S3 bucket criteria.To specify bucket criteria for the jobOpen the Macie console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/macie/.\nIn the navigation pane, choose Jobs.\n\nChoose Create job.\n\nOn the Choose S3 buckets page, choose Specify bucket criteria.\n\nUnder Specify bucket criteria, do the following to add a condition to the criteria:\n\nPlace your cursor in the filter bar, and then choose the bucket property to use for the condition.\n\nIn the first field, choose an operator for the condition, Equals or Not equals.\n\nIn the next field, enter one or more values for the property.\nDepending on the type and nature of the bucket property, Macie displays different options for entering values. For example, if you choose the Effective permission property, Macie displays a list of values to choose from. If you choose the Account ID property, Macie displays a text box in which you can enter one or more AWS account IDs. To enter multiple values in a text box, enter each value and separate each entry with a comma.\n\nChoose Apply. Macie adds the condition to a filter box below the filter bar.\nBy default, Macie adds the condition with an include statement. This means that the job is configured to analyze (include) objects in buckets that match the condition. To skip (exclude) buckets that match the condition, choose Include in the filter box, and then choose Exclude.\n\nRepeat the preceding steps for each additional condition that you want to add to the criteria.

"text": "To define the schedule and refine the scope of the job\nOn the Refine the scope page, choose how often you want the job to run: To run the job only once, immediately after you finish creating it, choose One-time job.\n\nTo run the job periodically on a recurring basis, choose Scheduled job. For Update frequency, choose whether to run the job daily, weekly, or monthly. Then use the Include existing objects option to define the scope of the job's first run: Select this check box to analyze all existing objects immediately after you finish creating the job. Each subsequent run analyzes only those objects that are created or changed after the preceding run.\n\nClear this check box to skip analysis of all existing objects. The job's first run analyzes only those objects that are created or changed after you finish creating the job and before the first run starts. Each subsequent run analyzes only those objects that are created or changed after the preceding run.\nClearing this check box is helpful for cases where you've already analyzed the data and want to continue to analyze it periodically. For example, if you previously used another service or application to classify data and you recently started using Macie, you might use this option to ensure continued discovery and classification of your data without incurring unnecessary costs or duplicating classification data. (Optional) To specify the percentage of objects that you want the job to analyze, enter the percentage in the Sampling depth box. If this value is less than 100%, Macie selects the objects to analyze at random, up to the specified percentage, and analyzes all the data in those objects. The default value is 100%.\n\n(Optional) To add specific criteria that determine which S3 objects are included or excluded from the job's analysis, expand the Additional settings section, and then enter the criteria. These criteria consist of individual conditions that derive from properties of objects. To analyze (include) objects that meet a specific condition, enter the condition type and value, and then choose Include.\n\nTo skip (exclude) objects that meet a specific condition, enter the condition type and value, and then choose Exclude.\n\nRepeat this step for each include or exclude condition that you want.\nIn Macie, exclude conditions take precedence over include conditions. For example, if you include objects that have the .pdf file name extension and exclude objects that are larger than 5 MB, the job analyzes any object that has the .pdf file name extension, unless the object is larger than 5 MB.\n\nWhen you finish, choose Next.",

The monthly service quota was lifted for the affected account. Applies to one-time and periodic jobs that Macie stopped temporarily (paused) and subsequently resumed.\nIf Macie automatically paused a one-time job, Macie automatically resumes the job when the subsequent month starts or the monthly sensitive data discovery quota is increased for all the affected accounts, whichever occurs first.

Applies to one-time and periodic jobs that use runtime bucket criteria to determine which S3 buckets to analyze. SCHEDULED_RUN_COMPLETED\n\nThe scheduled job run finished running. Applies only to periodic jobs. To log completion of a one-time job, Macie publishes a JOB_COMPLETED event, not this type of event. JOB_PAUSED_BY_USER The job was paused by a user. Applies to one-time and periodic jobs that you stopped temporarily (paused). JOB_RESUMED_BY_USER The job was resumed by a user. Applies to one-time and periodic jobs that you stopped temporarily (paused) and subsequently resumed. JOB_PAUSED_BY_MACIE_SERVICE_QUOTA_MET The job was paused by Macie. Completion of the job would exceed a monthly quota for the affected account. Applies to one-time and periodic jobs that Macie stopped temporarily (paused).\nMacie automatically pauses a job when additional processing by the job or a job run would exceed the monthly sensitive data discovery quota for one or more accounts that the job analyzes data for. To avoid this issue, consider increasing the quota for the affected accounts. JOB_RESUMED_BY_MACIE_SERVICE_QUOTA_LIFTED The job was resumed by Macie. The monthly service quota was lifted for the affected account. Applies to one-time and periodic jobs that Macie stopped temporarily (paused) and subsequently resumed.\nIf Macie automatically paused a one-time job, Macie automatically resumes the job when the subsequent month starts or the monthly sensitive data discovery quota is increased for all the affected accounts, whichever occurs first. If Macie automatically paused a periodic job, Macie automatically resumes the job when the next run is scheduled to start or the subsequent month starts, whichever occurs first. JOB_CANCELLED\n\nThe job was cancelled.\n\nApplies to one-time and periodic jobs that you stopped permanently (cancelled) or, for one-time jobs, paused and didn't resume within 30 days.\nIf you suspend or disable Macie, this type of event also applies to jobs that were active or paused when you suspended or disabled Macie. Macie automatically cancels your jobs in an AWS Region if you suspend or disable Macie in the Region. JOB_COMPLETED The job finished running. Applies only to one-time jobs. To log completion of a job run for a periodic job, Macie publishes a SCHEDULED_RUN_COMPLETED event, not this type of event.",

"text": "Log event\n\nThis is a record of an event that occurred while the job was running. Macie automatically logs and publishes data for certain events to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. The data in these logs provides a record of changes to the job's progress or status, such as the exact date and time when the job started or stopped running. The data also provides details about any account- or bucket-level errors that occurred while the job ran.\nLog events can help you monitor a job and address any issues that prevented the job from analyzing the data that you want. If a job uses runtime criteria to determine which S3 buckets to analyze, log events can also help you determine whether and which S3 buckets matched the criteria when the job ran.\nYou can access log events by using the Amazon CloudWatch console or the Amazon CloudWatch Logs API. To help you navigate to the log events for a job, the Amazon Macie console provides a link to them. For more information, see Monitoring jobs.\n\nSensitive data finding\n\nThis is a report of sensitive data that Macie found in an object. Each finding provides a severity rating and details such as: The date and time when Macie found the sensitive data.\n\nThe category and types of sensitive data that Macie found.\n\nThe number of occurrences of each type of sensitive data that Macie found.\n\nThe location of as many as 15 occurrences of the sensitive data that Macie found.\n\nThe unique identifier for the job that produced the finding.\n\nThe name, public access settings, encryption type, and other information about the affected S3 bucket and object.\n\nA sensitive data finding doesn't include the sensitive data that Macie found. Instead, it provides information that you can use for further investigation and remediation as necessary.\nMacie stores sensitive data findings for 90 days. You can access them by using the Amazon Macie console or the Amazon Macie API. You can also monitor and process them by using other applications, services, and systems. For more information, see Analyzing findings.\n\nSensitive data discovery result\n\nThis is a record that logs details about the analysis of an object. Macie creates a sensitive data discovery result for each object that you configure a job to analyze. This includes objects that don't contain sensitive data, and therefore don't produce a sensitive data finding, and objects that Macie can't analyze due to issues such as permissions settings or use of an unsupported format.\nIf an object does contain sensitive data, the sensitive data discovery result includes data from the corresponding sensitive data finding. It provides additional information too, such as the location of as many as 1,000 occurrences of each type of sensitive data that Macie found in the object. For example: The column and row number for a cell or field in a Microsoft Excel workbook, CSV file, or TSV file\n\nThe path to a field or array in a JSON or JSON Lines file\n\nThe line number for a line in a non-binary text file other than a CSV, JSON, JSON Lines, or TSV file\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example, an HTML, TXT, or XML file\n\nThe page number for a page in an Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) file\n\nThe record index and the path to a field in a record in an Apache Avro object container or Apache Parquet file\n\nIf an object is an archive file, such as a .tar or .zip file, a sensitive data discovery result also provides detailed location data for occurrences of sensitive data in individual files that Macie extracts from the archive file. (Macie doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t include this information in sensitive data findings for archive files.)\nNote that a sensitive data discovery result doesn't include the sensitive data that Macie found. Instead, it provides you with an analysis record that can be helpful for data privacy and protection audits or investigations.\nMacie stores sensitive data discovery results for 90 days. You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t access them directly on the Amazon Macie console or through the Amazon Macie API. Instead, you configure Macie to store the results in an S3 bucket. You can then optionally access and query the results in that bucket. This configuration also ensures long-term storage and retention of the results. To learn how to configure these settings, see Storing and retaining sensitive data discovery results.\nTipFor samples of Amazon Athena queries that you can use to analyze sensitive data discovery results, visit the Amazon Macie Results Analytics repository on GitHub. This repository also provides step-by-step instructions for configuring Athena to retrieve and decrypt your sensitive data discovery results, and scripts for creating tables for the results.\nAfter you configure Macie to store your discovery results in an S3 bucket, Macie writes the results to JSON Lines (.jsonl) files and adds those files to the bucket as GNU Zip (.gz) files. To help you navigate to the results, the Amazon Macie console provides links to them.",

"text": "To review a job's configuration settingsOpen the Amazon Macie console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/macie/.\nIn the navigation pane, choose Jobs.\n\nOn the Jobs page, choose the name of the job whose settings you want to review. The details panel displays the configuration settings and other information about the job.\nDepending on the job's settings, the panel contains the following sections: General information \u00e2\u0080\u0093 This section indicates the current status of the job and it provides general information about the job\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example, the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the job and the most recent date and time when the job started to run. If you paused the job during the past 30 days, this section also indicates when you paused the job and when the job or job run will expire if you don't resume it.\n\nStatistics \u00e2\u0080\u0093 This section shows processing statistics for the job\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example, the number of times that the job has run and the approximate number of objects that the job has yet to process during its current run.\n\nScope \u00e2\u0080\u0093 This section indicates how often the job runs. It also shows settings that refine the job's scope\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example, the sampling depth and any object criteria that include or exclude S3 objects from the job's analysis.\n\nS3 buckets \u00e2\u0080\u0093 This section appears in the panel if the job is configured to analyze buckets that you explicitly selected when you created the job. It indicates the number of AWS accounts that the job is configured to analyze data for. It also indicates the number of buckets that the job is configured to analyze and the names of those buckets (grouped by account). To show the complete list of accounts and buckets in JSON format, choose the number in the Total buckets field.\n\nS3 bucket criteria \u00e2\u0080\u0093 This section appears in the panel if the job uses runtime criteria to determine which buckets to analyze. It lists any inclusion and exclusion criteria that the job is configured to use. To review the criteria in JSON format, choose Details, and then choose the Criteria tab in the window that appears.\nTipTo review a table of buckets that currently match the criteria, choose Details, and then choose the Matching buckets tab in the window that appears. Optionally choose refresh (\n\n) to retrieve the latest data.If the job has already run, you can also determine whether any buckets matched the criteria when the job ran and, if so, the names of those buckets. You can do this by reviewing the job status log events for the job. To do this, choose Show results at the top of the panel, and then choose Show CloudWatch logs. Macie opens the Amazon CloudWatch console and displays a table of log events for the job, including a BUCKET_MATCHED_THE_CRITERIA event for each bucket that matched the criteria and was included in the job's analysis.\n\nCustom data identifiers \u00e2\u0080\u0093 This section appears in the panel if the job is configured to use custom data identifiers when it analyzes objects. It lists the names of those custom data identifiers.\n\nManaged data identifiers \u00e2\u0080\u0093 This section indicates which managed data identifiers the job is configured to use when it analyzes objects. This is determined by the managed data identifier selection type for the job: Include all \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Use all the managed data identifiers that are available when the job runs.\n\nInclude selected \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Use only the managed data identifiers listed in the Selections section.\n\nExclude selected \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Use all the managed data identifiers that are available when the job runs, except the ones listed in the Selections section.\n\nExclude all \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Don't use any managed data identifiers.\n\nTo review these settings in JSON format, choose Details.\n\nTags \u00e2\u0080\u0093 This section appears in the panel if tags are associated with the job. It lists those tags.\nA\u00c2\u00a0tag\u00c2\u00a0is a label that you define and assign to certain types of AWS resources. Each tag consists of a required tag key and an optional tag value. Tags can help you identify, categorize, and manage resources in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria. To learn more, see Tagging Amazon Macie resources. (Optional) To review and save the job's settings in JSON format, choose the unique identifier for the job (Job ID) at the top of the panel, and then choose Download.",

This value doesn't apply to one-time jobs.\n\nActive (Running)\n\nFor a one-time job, the job is currently in progress. For a periodic job, a scheduled run is in progress.\n\nCancelled\n\nFor any type of job, the job was stopped permanently (cancelled).\nA job has this status if you explicitly cancelled it or, if it's a one-time job, you paused the job and didn't resume it within 30 days. A job can also have this status if you previously suspended Macie in the current AWS Region.\n\nComplete\n\nFor a one-time job, the job ran successfully and is now complete. This value doesn't apply to periodic jobs. Instead, the status of a periodic job changes to Active (Idle) when each run completes successfully.\n\nPaused (By Macie)\n\nFor any type of job, the job was stopped temporarily (paused) by Macie.\nA job has this status if completion of the job or a job run would exceed the monthly sensitive data discovery quota for your account. When this happens, Macie automatically pauses the job until the next calendar month starts (and the monthly quota is reset for your account) or you increase the quota for your account.\nIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re the Macie administrator for an organization and you configured the job to analyze data for member accounts, the job can also have this status if completion of the job or a job run would exceed the monthly sensitive data discovery quota for a member account.\nIf a job is running and the analysis of eligible objects reaches this quota for a member account, the job stops analyzing objects that are owned by the account. When the job finishes analyzing objects for all other accounts that haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t met the quota, Macie automatically pauses the job. If it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a one-time job, Macie automatically resumes the job when the next calendar month starts or the quota is increased for all the affected accounts, whichever occurs first. If it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a periodic job, Macie automatically resumes the job when the next run is scheduled to start or the next calendar month starts, whichever occurs first. If a scheduled run starts before the next calendar month starts or the quota is increased for an affected account, the job doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t analyze objects that are owned by the account.\n\nPaused (By user)\n\nFor any type of job, the job was stopped temporarily (paused) by you.\nIf you pause a one-time job and you don't resume it within 30 days, the job expires and Macie cancels it. If you pause a periodic job while it's actively running and you don't resume it within 30 days, the job's run expires and Macie cancels the run.

"text": "Reviewing estimated costs for individual buckets (step 2)\n\nIf you explicitly select individual buckets for a job to analyze, you can review the estimated cost of analyzing objects in each of those buckets. Macie displays these estimates during step 2 of the job creation process, when you review your bucket selections. In the table for this step, the Estimated cost field indicates the total estimated cost (in US Dollars) of running the job once to analyze objects in a bucket.\nEach estimate reflects the projected amount of uncompressed data that the job will analyze in a bucket, based on the size and types of objects that are currently stored in the bucket. The estimate also reflects Macie pricing for the current AWS Region.\nOnly classifiable objects are included in the cost estimate for a bucket. A classifiable object is an S3 object that uses a supported Amazon S3 storage class (S3 Intelligent-Tiering, S3 One Zone-IA, S3 Standard, or S3 Standard-IA) and has a file name extension for a supported file or storage format. If any classifiable objects are compressed or archive files, the estimate assumes that the files use a 3:1 compression ratio and the job can analyze all extracted files.\n\nReviewing the total estimated cost of a job (step 7)\n\nIf you create a one-time job or you create and configure a periodic job to include existing S3 objects, Macie calculates and displays the job's total estimated cost during the final step (step 7) of the job creation process. You can review this estimate while you review and verify all the settings that you selected for the job.\nThis estimate indicates the total projected cost (in US Dollars) of running the job once in the current Region. The estimate reflects the projected amount of uncompressed data that the job will analyze. It's based on the size and types of objects that are currently stored in buckets that you explicitly selected for the job or up to 500 buckets that currently match bucket criteria that you specified for the job, depending on the job's settings.\nNote that this estimate doesn't reflect any options that you selected to refine and reduce the scope of the job\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example, a lower sampling depth, or criteria that exclude certain S3 objects from the job. It also doesn't reflect your monthly sensitive data discovery quota, which might limit the scope and cost of the job's analysis, or any discounts that might apply to your account.\nIn addition to the total estimated cost of the job, the estimate provides aggregated data that offers insight into the projected scope and cost of the job: Size values indicate the total storage size of the objects that the job can and can't analyze.\n\nObject count values indicate the total number of objects that the job can and can't analyze.\n\nIn these values, a Classifiable object is an S3 object that uses a supported Amazon S3 storage class (S3 Intelligent-Tiering, S3 One Zone-IA, S3 Standard, or S3 Standard-IA) and has a file name extension for a supported file or storage format. Only classifiable objects are included in the cost estimate. A Not classifiable object is an object that doesn't use a supported Amazon S3 storage class or doesn't have a file name extension for a supported file or storage format. These objects aren't included in the cost estimate. \nThe estimate provides additional aggregated data for S3 objects that are compressed or archive files. The Compressed value indicates the total storage size of objects that use a supported Amazon S3 storage class and have a file name extension for a supported type of compressed or archive file. The Uncompressed value indicates the approximate size of these objects if they're decompressed, based on a specified compression ratio. This data is relevant due to the way that Macie analyzes compressed files and archive files.\nWhen Macie analyzes a compressed or archive file, it inspects both the full file and the contents of the file. To inspect the file\u00e2\u0080\u0099s contents, Macie decompresses the file, and then inspects each extracted file that uses a supported format. The actual amount of data that a job analyzes therefore depends on: Whether a file uses compression and, if so, the compression ratio that it uses.\n\nThe number, size, and format of the extracted files.\n\nBy default, Macie assumes the following when it calculates cost estimates for a job: All compressed and archive files use a 3:1 compression ratio.\n\nAll the extracted files use a supported file or storage format.\n\nThese assumptions can result in a larger size estimate for the scope of the data that the job will analyze, and, consequently, a higher cost estimate for the job. \nYou can recalculate the job's total estimated cost based on a different compression ratio. To do this, choose the ratio from the Choose an estimated compression ratio list in the Estimated cost section. Macie then updates the estimate to match your selection.",

"text": "To change the key's policy\nOpen the AWS KMS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms.\n\nTo change the AWS Region, use the Region selector in the upper-right corner of the page.\n\nChoose the key that you want to use to encrypt the results.\n\nOn the Key policy tab, choose Edit.\n\nCopy the following statement to your clipboard and then add it to the policy:\n{ \"Sid\": \"Allow Macie to use the key\", \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Principal\": { \"Service\": \"macie.amazonaws.com\" }, \"Action\": [ \"kms:GenerateDataKey\", \"kms:Encrypt\" ], \"Resource\": \"*\", \"Condition\": { \"StringEquals\": { \"aws:SourceAccount\": \"111122223333\" }, \"ArnLike\": { \"aws:SourceArn\": [ \"arn:aws:macie2:Region:111122223333:export-configuration:default\", \"arn:aws:macie2:Region:111122223333:classification-job/*\" ] } }\n}\nWhen you add the statement, make sure that the syntax is valid. Policies use JSON format. This means that you need to also add a comma before or after the statement, depending on where you add the statement to the policy. If you add the statement as the last statement, add a comma after the closing curly brace for the preceding statement. If you add it as the first statement or between two existing statements, add a comma after the closing curly brace for the statement.\n\nUpdate the statement with the correct values for your environment: In the Condition fields, replace the placeholder values, where: 111122223333 is the account ID for your AWS account.\n\nRegion is the AWS Region in which you're using Macie and you want to allow Macie to use the key.\nIf you use Macie in multiple Regions and want to allow Macie to use the key in additional Regions, add aws:SourceArn conditions for each additional Region. For example:\n\"aws:SourceArn\": [ \"arn:aws:macie2:us-east-1:111122223333:export-configuration:default\", \"arn:aws:macie2:us-east-1:111122223333:classification-job/*\", \"arn:aws:macie2:us-west-2:111122223333:export-configuration:default\", \"arn:aws:macie2:us-west-2:111122223333:classification-job/*\"\n]\nAlternatively, you can allow Macie to use the key in all Regions. To do this, replace the placeholder value with the wildcard character (*). For example:\n\"aws:SourceArn\": [ \"arn:aws:macie2:*:111122223333:export-configuration:default\", \"arn:aws:macie2:*:111122223333:classification-job/*\"\n] If you're using Macie in a manually enabled AWS Region, add the appropriate Region code to the value for the Service field. For example, if you're using Macie in the Middle East (Bahrain) Region, which has the Region code me-south-1, replace macie.amazonaws.com with macie.me-south-1.amazonaws.com.\n\nNote that the Condition fields use two IAM global condition keys: aws:SourceAccount \u00e2\u0080\u0093 This condition allows Macie to perform the specified actions only for your account. More specifically, it determines which account can perform the specified actions for the resources and actions specified by the aws:SourceArn condition.\nTo allow Macie to perform the specified actions for additional accounts, add the account ID for each additional account to this condition. For example:\n\"aws:SourceAccount\": [111122223333,444455556666]\n\naws:SourceArn \u00e2\u0080\u0093 This condition prevents other AWS services from performing the specified actions. It also prevents Macie from using the key while performing other actions for your account. In other words, it allows Macie to encrypt S3 objects with the key only if the objects are sensitive data discovery results, and only if those results are for sensitive data discovery jobs that are created by the account and in the Region specified in the condition.\nTo allow Macie to perform the specified actions for additional accounts, add ARNs for each additional account to this condition. For example:\n\"aws:SourceArn\": [ \"arn:aws:macie2:us-east-1:111122223333:export-configuration:default\", \"arn:aws:macie2:us-east-1:111122223333:classification-job/*\", \"arn:aws:macie2:us-east-1:444455556666:export-configuration:default\", \"arn:aws:macie2:us-east-1:444455556666:classification-job/*\"\n]\nThe accounts specified by the aws:SourceAccount and aws:SourceArn conditions should match.\n\nThese conditions help prevent Macie from being used as a confused deputy during transactions with AWS KMS. Although we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t recommend it, you can remove these conditions from the statement. When you finish adding and updating the statement, choose Save changes.",

"text": "If you prefer to use a new S3 bucket that Macie creates for you, the final step in the process is to configure the repository settings in Macie.To configure the repository settings in MacieOpen the Macie console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/macie/.\nIn the navigation pane, under Settings, choose Discovery results.\n\nUnder Repository for sensitive data discovery results, choose Create bucket.\n\nIn the Create a bucket box, enter a name for the bucket. The name must be unique across all S3 buckets. In addition, the name can consist only of lowercase letters, numbers, dots (.), and hyphens (-). For additional naming requirements, see Bucket naming rules in the Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide.\n\n(Optional) To specify a path prefix to use in the path to a location in the bucket, expand the Advanced section. Then, for Data discovery result prefix, enter the path prefix to use.\nWhen you enter a value, Macie updates the example below the field to show the path to the bucket location where it will store your discovery results.\n\nFor Block all public access, choose whether to enable all block public access settings for the bucket. For information about these settings, see Blocking public access to your Amazon S3 storage in the Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide.\n\nUnder KMS encryption, specify the AWS KMS key that you want to use to encrypt the results: To use a key for your own account, choose Select a key from your account. Then, in the KMS key alias list, choose the alias of the key to use.\n\nTo use a key that's owned by another account and you're allowed to use, choose Enter the ARN of a key in another account. Then, in the KMS key ARN field, enter the ARN of the key to use.\n\nThe key must be a customer managed, symmetric encryption KMS key that's in the same Region as the S3 bucket.\n\nWhen you finish entering the settings, choose Save. Macie tests the settings to verify that they're correct. If any settings are incorrect, Macie displays an error message to help you address the issue.\nAfter you save the repository settings, Macie adds existing discovery results for the preceding 90 days to the repository. Macie also starts adding new discovery results to the repository.If you prefer to store your sensitive data discovery results in a particular S3 bucket that you create, create and configure the bucket before you configure the repository settings in Macie. If you enabled Object Lock for the bucket, ensure that you disable the default retention setting for that feature. Otherwise, Macie won't be able to add your discovery results to the bucket. For information about this setting, see Using S3 Object Lock in the Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide.Then add a bucket policy that allows Macie to retrieve information about the bucket and add (put) objects to the bucket. You can then configure the repository settings in Macie.To add the bucket policy to the bucketOpen the Amazon S3 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/.\nChoose the bucket that you want to store your discovery results in.\n\nChoose the Permissions tab.\n\nIn the Bucket policy section, choose Edit.\n\nCopy the following example policy to your clipboard:\n{ \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Sid\": \"Allow Macie to use the GetBucketLocation operation\", \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Principal\": { \"Service\": \"macie.amazonaws.com\" }, \"Action\": \"s3:GetBucketLocation\", \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:s3:::myBucketName\", \"Condition\": { \"StringEquals\": { \"aws:SourceAccount\": \"111122223333\" }, \"ArnLike\": { \"aws:SourceArn\": [ \"arn:aws:macie2:Region:111122223333:export-configuration:default\", \"arn:aws:macie2:Region:111122223333:classification-job/*\" ] } } }, { \"Sid\": \"Allow Macie to add objects to the bucket\", \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Principal\": { \"Service\": \"macie.amazonaws.com\" }, \"Action\": \"s3:PutObject\", \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:s3:::myBucketName/[optional prefix]/*\", \"Condition\": { \"StringEquals\": { \"aws:SourceAccount\": \"111122223333\" }, \"ArnLike\": { \"aws:SourceArn\": [ \"arn:aws:macie2:Region:111122223333:export-configuration:default\", \"arn:aws:macie2:Region:111122223333:classification-job/*\" ] } } }, { \"Sid\": \"Deny unencrypted object uploads.

In all other statements, replace the placeholder values, where: myBucketName is the name of the bucket.\n\nRegion is the AWS Region in which you're using Macie and want to allow Macie to add discovery results to the bucket.\nIf you use Macie in multiple Regions and want to allow Macie to add results to the bucket for additional Regions, add aws:SourceArn conditions for each additional Region. For example:\n\"aws:SourceArn\": [ \"arn:aws:macie2:us-east-1:111122223333:export-configuration:default\", \"arn:aws:macie2:us-east-1:111122223333:classification-job/*\", \"arn:aws:macie2:us-west-2:111122223333:export-configuration:default\", \"arn:aws:macie2:us-west-2:111122223333:classification-job/*\"\n]\nAlternatively, you can allow Macie to add results to the bucket for all Regions in which you use Macie. To do this, replace the placeholder value with the wildcard character (*). For example:\n\"aws:SourceArn\": [ \"arn:aws:macie2:*:111122223333:export-configuration:default\", \"arn:aws:macie2:*:111122223333:classification-job/*\"\n]\n\n111122223333 is the account ID for your AWS account. If you're using Macie in a manually enabled AWS Region, add the appropriate Region code to the value for the Service field in each statement that specifies the Macie service principal. For example, if you're using Macie in the Middle East (Bahrain) Region, which has the Region code me-south-1, replace macie.amazonaws.com with macie.me-south-1.amazonaws.com in each applicable statement.\n\nNote that the example policy includes statements that allow Macie to determine which Region the bucket resides in (GetBucketLocation) and to add objects to the bucket (PutObject). These statements define conditions that use two IAM global condition keys: aws:SourceAccount \u00e2\u0080\u0093 This condition allows Macie to add sensitive data discovery results to the bucket only for your account. It prevents Macie from adding discovery results for other accounts to the bucket. More specifically, the condition specifies which account can use the bucket for the resources and actions specified by the aws:SourceArn condition.\nTo store results for additional accounts in the bucket, add the account ID for each additional account to this condition. For example:\n\"aws:SourceAccount\": [111122223333,444455556666]\n\naws:SourceArn \u00e2\u0080\u0093 This condition restricts access to the bucket based on the source of the objects that are being added to the bucket. It prevents other AWS services from adding objects to the bucket. It also prevents Macie from adding objects to the bucket while performing other actions for your account. More specifically, the condition allows Macie to add objects to the bucket only if the objects are sensitive data discovery results, and only if those results are for sensitive data discovery jobs that are created by the account and in the Region specified in the condition.\nTo allow Macie to perform the specified actions for additional accounts, add ARNs for each additional account to this condition. For example:\n\"aws:SourceArn\": [ \"arn:aws:macie2:us-east-1:111122223333:export-configuration:default\", \"arn:aws:macie2:us-east-1:111122223333:classification-job/*\", \"arn:aws:macie2:us-east-1:444455556666:export-configuration:default\", \"arn:aws:macie2:us-east-1:444455556666:classification-job/*\"\n]\nThe accounts specified by the aws:SourceAccount and aws:SourceArn conditions should match.\n\nBoth conditions help prevent Macie from being used as a confused deputy during transactions with Amazon S3. Although we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t recommend it, you can remove these conditions from the bucket policy.\n\nWhen you finish updating the bucket policy, choose Save changes. \nImportantIf you change the bucket path after you configure the repository settings in Macie, you have to update the bucket policy. Otherwise, Macie won't be allowed to add discovery results to the bucket.You can now configure the repository settings in Macie.To configure the repository settings in MacieOpen the Macie console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/macie/.\nIn the navigation pane, under Settings, choose Discovery results.\n\nUnder Repository for sensitive data discovery results, choose Existing bucket.\n\nFor Choose a bucket, select the bucket that you want to store your discovery results in.\n\n(Optional) To specify a path prefix to use in the path to a location in the bucket, expand the Advanced section.

"text": "Amazon Macie console\n\nThe Findings pages on the Amazon Macie console list your findings and provide detailed information for individual findings. These pages also provide options for grouping, filtering, and sorting findings, and for creating and managing suppression rules. Suppression rules can help you streamline your analysis of findings.\n\nAmazon Macie API\n\nWith the Amazon Macie API, you can query and retrieve findings data by sending HTTPS requests directly to Macie or by using the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) or another AWS tool or SDK of your choice. To query the data, you send a request to the Amazon Macie API and use supported parameters to specify which findings you want to retrieve. After you submit your query, Macie returns the results in a JSON response. You can then pass the results to another service or application for deeper analysis, long-term storage, or reporting. For more information, see the Amazon Macie API Reference.\n\nAmazon EventBridge To further support integration with other services and systems, such as monitoring or event management systems, Macie publishes findings to Amazon EventBridge as events. EventBridge, formerly Amazon CloudWatch Events, is a serverless event bus service that can deliver a stream of real-time data from your own applications, software as a service (SaaS) applications, and AWS services such as Macie. It can route that data to targets such as AWS Lambda functions, Amazon Simple Notification Service topics, and Amazon Kinesis streams. To learn about this service, see the Amazon EventBridge User Guide.\nMacie automatically publishes events to EventBridge for new findings. It also publishes events automatically for subsequent occurrences of existing policy findings. Because the notifications are structured as EventBridge events, you can more easily monitor, analyze, and act upon findings by using other services and tools. For example, you might use EventBridge to automatically send specific types of new findings to an AWS Lambda function that, in turn, processes and sends the data to your security incident and event management (SIEM) system. In addition to automated processing, use of EventBridge events helps ensure longer-term retention of findings data. To learn about using EventBridge events for findings, see Monitoring and processing findings.\n\nAWS Security Hub For additional, broader analysis of your organization's security posture, you can also review and analyze findings by using AWS Security Hub. Security Hub is a service that provides you with a comprehensive view of your security state across your AWS environment and helps you check your environment against security industry standards and best practices.

With these pages, you can review aggregated statistics for each group, such as the count of findings by severity. You can also drill down to review the details of individual findings in a group, and you can apply filters to refine your analysis.\nFor example, if you group all findings by S3 bucket and note that a particular S3 bucket has a policy violation, you can quickly determine whether the bucket also contains sensitive data. To do this, choose By bucket in the navigation pane (under Findings), and then choose the bucket. In the details panel that appears, the Findings by type section lists the types of findings that apply to the bucket. To investigate a specific type, choose the number for the type. Macie displays a table of all the findings that match the selected type and apply to the bucket. To refine the results, filter the table.\n\nApply attribute-based filters\n\nUse specific finding attributes to include or exclude certain findings from a Findings table. A finding attribute is a field that stores specific data for a finding, such as finding type, severity, or the name of the S3 bucket that the finding applies to. If you filter a table, you can more easily identify findings that have specific characteristics. Then you can drill down to review the details of those findings.\nFor example, to review all of your policy findings, add filter criteria for the Category field. To refine your view and include only a specific type of policy finding, add filter criteria for the Finding type field. To then review the details of a particular finding, choose the finding. The details panel displays information for the finding.",

By default, this doesn't include findings that were suppressed by a suppression rule.\n\n(Optional) To pivot on and review findings by a predefined logical group, choose By bucket, By type, or By job in the navigation pane (under Findings), and then choose an item in the table. In the details panel, choose the link for the field to pivot on.\n\n(Optional) To filter the findings by specific criteria, use the filter bar above the table: To display findings that were suppressed by a suppression rule, choose Current in the filter bar. Then choose Archived to display only suppressed findings, or choose All to display both current and suppressed findings. To display only those findings that have a specific attribute, place your cursor in the filter bar and add a filter condition for the attribute. To further refine the results, add conditions for additional attributes. For information about using filter conditions, see Creating and applying filters to findings.\n\nTo remove a filter condition, choose the remove condition icon (\n\n) in the filter box.\n\nTo save your filter settings, choose Save rule in the filter bar. Then enter a name and, optionally, a description for the settings. When you finish, choose Save.\n\n(Optional) To sort the findings by a specific field, click the column heading for the field. To change the sort order, click the column heading again.\n\nTo review the details of a specific finding, choose any field other than the check box for the finding.

Macie displays information (in JSON format) about where Macie found the data. To learn more, see Locating sensitive data with findings.\n\nTo navigate to the corresponding sensitive data discovery result, choose the link in the Detailed result location field.

"text": "To locate occurrences of sensitive dataOpen the Amazon Macie console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/macie/.\nIn the navigation pane, choose Findings.\nTipYou can use the Jobs page to display all the findings from a particular job. To do this, choose Jobs in the navigation pane, and then choose the name of the job. At the top of the details panel, choose Show results, and then choose Show findings.\n\nOn the Findings page, choose the finding for the sensitive data that you want to locate. The details panel displays information for the finding.\n\nIn the details panel, scroll to the Details section. This section provides information about the categories and types of sensitive data that Macie found in the affected S3 object. It also indicates the number of occurrences of each type of sensitive data that Macie found.\nFor example, the following image shows some details of a finding that reports 30 occurrences of credit card numbers, 30 occurrences of names, and 30 occurrences of US Social Security numbers. If the finding includes details about the location of one or more occurrences of a specific type of sensitive data, the number of occurrences is a link. Choose the link to show the details. Macie opens a new window and displays the details in JSON format.\nFor example, the following image shows the location of two occurrences of credit card numbers in an affected object. To save the details as a JSON file, choose Download, and then and specify a name and location for the file.\n\n(Optional) To save all the finding's details as a JSON file, choose the finding's identifier (Finding ID) at the top of the details panel. Macie opens a new window and displays all the details in JSON format. Choose Download, and then specify a name and location for the file.",

"text": "Array of text (strings)\n\nSpecifies a list of text (string) values for a field. Each string correlates to a predefined or existing value for a field\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example, High for the Severity field, SensitiveData:S3Object/Financial for the Finding type field, or the name of an S3 bucket for the S3 bucket name field.\nIf you use an array, note the following: Values are case sensitive.\n\nYou can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t specify partial values or use wildcard characters in values. You have to specify a complete, valid value for the field. For example, to filter findings for an S3 bucket named my-S3-bucket, enter my-S3-bucket as the value for the S3 bucket name field. If you enter any other value, such as my-s3-bucket or my-S3, Macie won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t return findings for the bucket.\nFor a list of valid values for each field, see Fields for filtering findings.\nYou can specify as many as 50 values in an array. How you specify the values depends on whether you use the Amazon Macie console or the Amazon Macie API, as discussed in Specifying multiple values for a field. Boolean\n\nSpecifies one of two mutually exclusive values for a field.\nIf you use the Amazon Macie console to specify this type of value, the console provides a list of values to choose from. If you use the Amazon Macie API, specify true or false for the value.\n\nDate/Time (and time ranges)\n\nSpecifies an absolute date and time for a field. If you specify this type of value, you have to specify both a date and time.\nOn the Amazon Macie console, date and time values are in your local time zone and use 24-hour notation. In all other contexts, these values are in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and extended ISO 8601 format\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example 2020-09-01T14:31:13Z for 2:31:13 PM UTC September 1, 2020.\nIf a field stores a date/time value, you can use the field to define a fixed or relative time range. For example, you can include only those findings that were created between two specific dates and times, or only those findings that were created before or after a specific date and time. How you define a time range depends on whether you use the Amazon Macie console or the Amazon Macie API: On the console, use a date picker or enter text directly in the From and To boxes. With the API, define a fixed time range by adding a condition that specifies the first date and time in the range, and add another condition that specifies the last date and time in the range. If you do this, Macie uses AND logic to join the conditions. To define a relative time range, add one condition that specifies the first or last date and time in the range. Specify the values as Unix timestamps in milliseconds\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example, 1604616572653 for 22:49:32 UTC November 5, 2020.\n\nOn the console, time ranges are inclusive. With the API, time ranges can be inclusive or exclusive, depending on the operator that you choose.\n\nNumber (and numeric ranges)\n\nSpecifies a long integer for a field.\nIf a field stores a numeric value, you can use the field to define a fixed or relative numeric range. For example, you can include only those findings that report 50-90 occurrences of sensitive data in an S3 object. How you define a numeric range depends on whether you use the Amazon Macie console or the Amazon Macie API: On the console, use the From and To boxes to enter the lowest and highest numbers in the range, respectively.\n\nWith the API, define a fixed numeric range by adding a condition that specifies the lowest number in the range, and add another condition that specifies the highest number in the range. If you do this, Macie uses AND logic to join the conditions. To define a relative numeric range, add one condition that specifies the lowest or highest number in the range.\n\nOn the console, numeric ranges are inclusive. With the API, numeric ranges can be inclusive or exclusive, depending on the operator that you choose.\n\nText (string)\n\nSpecifies a single text (string) value for a field. The string correlates to a predefined or existing value for a field\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example, High for the Severity field, the name of an S3 bucket for the S3 bucket name field, or the unique identifier for a sensitive data discovery job for the Job ID field.\nIf you specify a single text string, note the following: Values are case sensitive.\n\nYou can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t use partial values or use wildcard characters in values. You have to specify a complete, valid value for the field. For example, to filter findings for an S3 bucket named my-S3-bucket, enter my-S3-bucket as the value for the S3 bucket name field. If you enter any other value, such as my-s3-bucket or my-S3, Macie won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t return findings for the bucket.\nFor a list of valid values for each field, see Fields for filtering findings.",

"text": "Equals (eq)\n\nMatches (=) any value specified for the field. You can use the equals operator with the following types of values: array of text (strings), Boolean, date/time, number, and text (string).\nFor many fields, you can use this operator and specify as many as 50 values for the field. If you do this, Macie uses OR logic to join the values. This means that a finding matches the criteria if it has any of the values specified for the field.\nFor example: To include findings that report occurrences of financial information, personal information, or both financial and personal information, add a condition that uses the Sensitive data category field and this operator, and specify Financial information and Personal information as the values for the field.\n\nTo include findings that report occurrences of credit card numbers, mailing addresses, or both credit card numbers and mailing addresses, add a condition for the Sensitive data detection type field, use this operator, and specify CREDIT_CARD_NUMBER and ADDRESS as the values for the field.\n\nIf you use the Amazon Macie API to define a condition that uses this operator with a date/time value, specify the value as a Unix timestamp in \nmilliseconds\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example, 1604616572653 for 22:49:32 UTC November 5, 2020.\n\nEquals exact match (eqExactMatch)\n\nExclusively matches all the values specified for the field. You can use the equals exact match operator with a select set of fields. \nIf you use this operator and specify multiple values for a field, Macie uses AND logic to join the values. This means that a finding matches the criteria only if it has all the values specified for the field and only those values for the field. You can specify as many as 50 values for the field.\nFor example: To include findings that report occurrences of credit card numbers and no other type of sensitive data, add a condition for the Sensitive data detection type field, use this operator, and specify CREDIT_CARD_NUMBER as the only value for the field.\n\nTo include findings that report occurrences of both credit card numbers and mailing addresses (and no other types of sensitive data), add a condition for the Sensitive data detection type field, use this operator, and specify CREDIT_CARD_NUMBER and ADDRESS as the values for the field.\n\nBecause Macie uses AND logic to join the values for a field, you can't use this operator in combination with any other operators for the same field. In other words, if you use the equals exact match operator with a field in one condition, you have to use it in all other conditions that use the same field.\nLike other operators, you can use the equals exact match operator in more than one condition in a filter. If you do this, Macie uses AND logic to join the conditions and evaluate the filter. This means that a finding matches the filter criteria only if it has all the values specified by all the conditions in the filter.\nFor example, to include findings that were created after a certain time, report occurrences of credit card numbers, and don't report any other type of sensitive data, do the following: Add a condition that uses the Created at field, uses the greater than operator, and specifies the starting date and time for the filter.\n\nAdd another condition that uses the Sensitive data detection type field, uses the equals exact match operator, and specifies CREDIT_CARD_NUMBER as the only value for the field.\n\nYou can use the equals exact match operator with the following fields: Custom data identifier detection ARN (customDataIdentifiers.detections.arn)\n\nCustom data identifier detection name (customDataIdentifiers.detections.name)\n\nS3 bucket tag key (resourcesAffected.s3Bucket.tags.key)\n\nS3 bucket tag value (resourcesAffected.s3Bucket.tags.value)\n\nS3 object tag key (resourcesAffected.s3Object.tags.key)\n\nS3 object tag value (resourcesAffected.s3Object.tags.value)\n\nSensitive data detection type (sensitiveData.detections.type)\n\nSensitive data category (sensitiveData.category)\n\nIn the preceding list, the parenthetical name uses dot notation to indicate the name of the field in JSON representations of findings and the Amazon Macie API.\n\nGreater than (gt)\n\nIs greater than (>) the value specified for the field. You can use the greater than operator with number and date/time values. \nFor example, to include only those findings that report more than 90 occurrences of sensitive data in an S3 object, add a condition that uses the Sensitive data total count field and this operator, and specify 90 as the value for the field. To do this on the Amazon Macie console, enter 91 in the From box, don't enter a value in the To box, and then choose Apply. Numeric and time-based comparisons are inclusive on the console.\nIf you use the Amazon Macie API to define a time range that uses this operator, you have to specify the date/time values as Unix timestamps in \nmilliseconds\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example, 1604616572653 for 22:49:32 UTC November 5, 2020.\n\nGreater than or equal to (gte)\n\nIs greater than or equal to (>=) the value specified for the field. You can use the greater than or equal to operator with number and date/time values.\nFor example, to include only those findings that report 90 or more occurrences of sensitive data in an S3 object, add a condition that uses the Sensitive data total count field and this operator, and specify 90 as the value for the field. To do this on the Amazon Macie console, enter 90 in the From box, don't enter a value in the To box, and then choose Apply.\nIf you use the Amazon Macie API to define a time range that uses this operator, you have to specify the date/time values as Unix timestamps in \nmilliseconds\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example, 1604616572653 for 22:49:32 UTC November 5, 2020.\n\nLess than (lt)\n\nIs less than (<) the value specified for the field. You can use the less than operator with number and date/time values.\nFor example, to include only those findings that report fewer than 90 occurrences of sensitive data in an S3 object, add a condition that uses the Sensitive data total count field and this operator, and specify 90 as the value for the field. To do this on the Amazon Macie console, enter 89 in the To box, don't enter a value in the From box, and then choose Apply. Numeric and time-based comparisons are inclusive on the console.\nIf you use the Amazon Macie API to define a time range that uses this operator, you have to specify the date/time values as Unix timestamps in \nmilliseconds\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example, 1604616572653 for 22:49:32 UTC November 5, 2020.\n\nLess than or equal to (lte)\n\nIs less than or equal to (<=) the value specified for the field. You can use the less than or equal to operator with number and date/time values.\nFor example, to include only those findings that report 90 or fewer occurrences of sensitive data in an S3 object, add a condition that uses the Sensitive data total count field and this operator, and specify 90 as the value for the field. To do this on the Amazon Macie console, enter 90 in the To box, don't enter a value in the From box, and then choose Apply.\nIf you use the Amazon Macie API to define a time range that uses this operator, you have to specify the date/time values as Unix timestamps in \nmilliseconds\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example, 1604616572653 for 22:49:32 UTC November 5, 2020.\n\nNot equals (neq)\n\nDoesn't match (\u00e2\u0089\u00a0) any value specified for the field. You can use the not equals operator with the following types of values: array of text (strings), Boolean, date/time, number, and text (string).\nFor many fields, you can use this operator and specify as many as 50 values for the field. If you do this, Macie uses OR logic to join the values. This means that a finding matches the criteria if it doesn't have any of the values specified for the field.\nFor example: To exclude findings that report occurrences of financial information, personal information, or both financial and personal information, add a condition that uses the Sensitive data category field and this operator, and specify Financial information and Personal information as the values for the field.\n\nTo exclude findings that report occurrences of credit card numbers, add a condition for the Sensitive data detection type field, use this operator, and specify CREDIT_CARD_NUMBER as the value for the field.\n\nTo exclude findings that report occurrences of credit card numbers, mailing addresses, or both credit card numbers and mailing addresses, add a condition for the Sensitive data detection type field, use this operator, and specify CREDIT_CARD_NUMBER and ADDRESS as the values for the field.\n\nIf you use the Amazon Macie API to define a condition that uses this operator with a date/time value, specify the value as a Unix timestamp in \nmilliseconds\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example, 1604616572653 for 22:49:32 UTC November 5, 2020.",

"text": "To filter findings using the consoleOpen the Amazon Macie console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/macie/.\nIn the navigation pane, choose Findings.\n\n(Optional) To first view and pivot on findings by a predefined logical group, choose By bucket, By type, or By job in the navigation pane (under Findings), and then choose an item in the table. In the details panel, choose the link for the field to pivot on.\n\n(Optional) To display findings that were suppressed by a suppression rule, choose Current in the filter bar. Then choose Archived to display only suppressed findings, or choose All to display both current and suppressed findings. To add a filter condition:\n\nPlace your cursor in the filter bar, and then choose the field to use for the condition. For information about the fields that you can use, see Fields for filtering findings.\n\nEnter the appropriate type of value for the field. For detailed information about the different types of values, see Specifying values for fields. Array of text (strings)\n\nFor this type of value, Macie often provides a list of values to choose from. If this is the case, select each value that you want to use in the condition.\nIf Macie doesn't provide a list of values, enter a complete, valid value for the field. To specify additional values for the field, choose Apply, and then add another condition for each additional value.\nNote that values are case sensitive. In addition, you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t use partial values or wildcard characters in values. For example, to filter findings for an S3 bucket named my-S3-bucket, enter my-S3-bucket as the value for the S3 bucket name field. If you enter any other value, such as my-s3-bucket or my-S3, Macie won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t return findings for the bucket.\n\nBoolean\n\nFor this type of value, Macie provides a list of values to choose from. Select the value that you want to use in the condition.\n\nDate/Time (time ranges)\n\nFor this type of value, use the From and To boxes to define an inclusive time range: To define a fixed time range, use the From and To boxes to specify the first date and time and the last date and time in the range, respectively.\n\nTo define a relative time range that starts at a certain date and time and ends at the current time, enter the start date and time in the From boxes, and delete any text in To boxes.\n\nTo define a relative time range that ends at a certain date and time, enter the end date and time in the To boxes, and delete any text in the From boxes.\n\nNote that time values use 24-hour notation. If you use the date picker to choose dates, you can refine the values by entering text directly in the From and To boxes.\n\nNumber (numeric ranges)\n\nFor this type of value, use the From and To boxes to enter one or more integers that define an inclusive, fixed or relative numeric range.\n\nText (string) values\n\nFor this type of value, enter a complete, valid value for the field.\nNote that values are case sensitive. In addition, you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t use partial values or wildcard characters in values. For example, to filter findings for an S3 bucket named my-S3-bucket, enter my-S3-bucket as the value for the S3 bucket name field. If you enter any other value, such as my-s3-bucket or my-S3, Macie won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t return findings for the bucket. When you finish adding values for the field, choose Apply. Macie applies the filter criteria and adds the condition to a filter box in the filter bar. Repeat step 5 for each additional condition that you want to add.\n\nTo remove a condition, choose the remove condition icon (\n\n) in the filter box for the condition.\n\nTo change a condition, remove the condition by choosing the remove condition icon (\n\n) in the filter box for the condition. Then repeat step 5 to add a condition with the correct settings.",

"text": "New findings \u00e2\u0080\u0093 When Macie creates a new policy or sensitive data finding, it assigns a unique identifier to the finding as part of processing the finding. Immediately after Macie finishes processing the finding, it publishes the finding as a new EventBridge event. Depending on the publication settings for your account, Macie also publishes the finding as a new finding in Security Hub.\n\nUpdated findings \u00e2\u0080\u0093 When Macie detects a subsequent occurrence of an existing policy finding, it updates the existing finding by adding details about the subsequent occurrence and incrementing the count of occurrences. Macie also publishes these updates to the existing EventBridge event and, depending on the publication settings for your account, the existing Security Hub finding. Macie does this only for policy findings. Sensitive data findings, unlike policy findings, are all treated as new (unique) because they derive from individual sensitive data discovery jobs.\nBy default, Macie publishes updated findings every 15 minutes as part of a recurring publication cycle. This means that any policy findings that are updated after the most recent publication cycle will be held, updated again as necessary, and included in the next publication cycle (approximately 15 minutes later). You can change this schedule by choosing a different publication frequency. For example, if you configure Macie to publish updated findings every hour and a publication occurs at 12:00, then any updates that occur after 12:00 are published at 13:00.",

"text": "An organization can have only one delegated Macie administrator account.An account can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be a Macie administrator and member account at the same time.Only the AWS Organizations management account for an organization can designate the delegated Macie administrator account for the organization, and only the management account can subsequently change or remove that designation.The AWS Organizations management account for an organization can also be the delegated Macie administrator account for the organization. However, we don't recommend this configuration based on AWS security best practices and the principle of least privilege. Users who have access to the management account for billing purposes are likely to be different from users who need access to Macie for information security purposes.\nIf you prefer this configuration, you must enable Macie for the organization's management account in at least one AWS Region before you designate the account as the delegated Macie administrator account. Otherwise, the account won't be able to access and manage Macie settings and resources for member accounts.Unlike AWS Organizations, Macie is a Regional service. This means that the designation of a Macie administrator account is a Regional designation. It also means that associations between Macie administrator and member accounts are Regional. For example, if the management account designates a Macie administrator account in the US East (N. Virginia) Region, the Macie administrator can manage Macie for member accounts only in that Region.\nTo centrally manage Macie accounts in multiple AWS Regions, the management account must log in to each Region where the organization currently uses or will use Macie, and then designate the Macie administrator account in each of those Regions. The Macie administrator can then configure the organization in each of those Regions. For a list of Regions where Macie is currently available, see Amazon Macie endpoints and quotas in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.An account can be associated with only one Macie administrator account at a time. If your organization uses Macie in multiple Regions, the designated Macie administrator account must be the same in all of those Regions. However, your organization\u00e2\u0080\u0099s management account must designate the administrator account separately in each Region.If the Macie administrator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s AWS account is suspended, isolated, or closed, all associated Macie member accounts are automatically removed as Macie member accounts but Macie isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t disabled for the accounts.",

If your organization exceeds this quota, the Macie administrator won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to add member accounts until they remove the necessary number of existing member accounts in the Region.\nWhen an organization meets this quota, we notify the Macie administrator by creating AWS Health and Amazon CloudWatch events for their account. We also send email to the address that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s associated with their account.\nIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re the Macie administrator for an organization, you can determine how many active member accounts are currently associated with your account by using the Accounts page on the Amazon Macie console or the DescribeOrganizationConfiguration operation of the Amazon Macie API. For more information, see Reviewing Amazon Macie accounts for an organization.An account can be associated with only one Macie administrator account at a time. This means that an account can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t accept a Macie invitation from another account if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s already associated with the Macie administrator account for an organization in AWS Organizations.\nSimilarly, if an account already accepted an invitation, the Macie administrator for an organization in AWS Organizations can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t add the account as a Macie member account. The account must first disassociate from its current, invitation-based administrator account.To add the AWS Organizations management account as a Macie member account, a user of the management account must first enable Macie for the account.

Only the Macie administrator can remove an account as a Macie member account.If the Macie administrator removes a Macie member account, Macie continues to be enabled for the account.

This is the case because Macie verifies the receiving account\u00e2\u0080\u0099s email address by using an email verification service that operates only in the US East (N. Virginia) Region.\n\nYou can send an invitation to any active AWS account, including accounts that haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t enabled Macie. However, to accept or decline an invitation, the receiving account must enable Macie in the Region that the invitation was sent from.\n\nA Macie administrator account can be associated with no more than 1,000 accounts in each AWS Region. This includes accounts that haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t responded to invitations yet. If your account meets this quota, you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t add or invite additional accounts until you remove the necessary number of associated accounts, receive the necessary number of declined invitations, or a combination of the two.\nTo determine how many accounts are currently associated with your account, you can use the Accounts page on the Amazon Macie console or the ListMembers operation of the Amazon Macie API. For more information, see Reviewing Amazon Macie accounts for an invitation-based organization.\n\nAn account can be associated with only one Macie administrator account at a time. This means that an account can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t accept your invitation if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s already associated with another Macie administrator account. The account must first disassociate from its current Macie administrator account.\n\nIn an invitation-based organization, a member account can disassociate from its Macie administrator account at any time. If this happens, Macie continues to be enabled for the account and the account becomes a standalone Macie account. Macie doesn't notify you if a member account disassociates from your administrator account. However, the account continues to appear in your account inventory and it has a status of Member resigned.\n\nIf you remove a member account from your organization, Macie continues to be enabled for the account and the account becomes a standalone Macie account.",

For more information, see Discovering sensitive data. In addition, these costs don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t vary based on the number of findings that your jobs produce.\nNote that these costs are restricted by the monthly sensitive data discovery quota for your account.

"text": "Temporary IAM user permissions \u00e2\u0080\u0093 An IAM user can assume an IAM role to temporarily take on different permissions for a specific task. Federated user access \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Instead of creating an IAM user, you can use existing identities from AWS Directory Service, your enterprise user directory, or a web identity provider. These are known as federated users. AWS assigns a role to a federated user when access is requested through an identity provider. For more information about federated users, see Federated users and roles in the IAM User Guide. Cross-account access \u00e2\u0080\u0093 You can use an IAM role to allow someone (a trusted principal) in a different account to access resources in your account. Roles are the primary way to grant cross-account access. However, with some AWS services, you can attach a policy directly to a resource (instead of using a role as a proxy). To learn the difference between roles and resource-based policies for cross-account access, see How IAM roles differ from resource-based policies in the IAM User Guide.\n\nCross-service access \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Some AWS services use features in other AWS services. For example, when you make a call in a service, it's common for that service to run applications in Amazon EC2 or store objects in Amazon S3. A service might do this using the calling principal's permissions, using a service role, or using a service-linked role. Principal permissions \u00e2\u0080\u0093 When you use an IAM user or role to perform actions in AWS, you are considered a principal. Policies grant permissions to a principal. When you use some services, you might perform an action that then triggers another action in a different service. In this case, you must have permissions to perform both actions. To see whether an action requires additional dependent actions in a policy, see Actions, resources, and condition keys for Amazon Macie in the Service Authorization Reference. Service role \u00e2\u0080\u0093 A service role is an IAM role that a service assumes to perform actions on your behalf. An IAM administrator can create, modify, and delete a service role from within IAM. For more information, see Creating a role to delegate permissions to an AWS service in the IAM User Guide. Service-linked role \u00e2\u0080\u0093 A service-linked role is a type of service role that is linked to an AWS service. The service can assume the role to perform an action on your behalf. Service-linked roles appear in your IAM account and are owned by the service. An IAM administrator can view, but not edit the permissions for service-linked roles. Applications running on Amazon EC2 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 You can use an IAM role to manage temporary credentials for applications that are running on an EC2 instance and making AWS CLI or AWS API requests. This is preferable to storing access keys within the EC2 instance. To assign an AWS role to an EC2 instance and make it available to all of its applications, you create an instance profile that is attached to the instance. An instance profile contains the role and enables programs that are running on the EC2 instance to get temporary credentials. For more information, see Using an IAM role to grant permissions to applications running on Amazon EC2 instances in the IAM User Guide.",

"text": "Permissions boundaries \u00e2\u0080\u0093 A permissions boundary is an advanced feature in which you set the maximum permissions that an identity-based policy can grant to an IAM entity (IAM user or role). You can set a permissions boundary for an entity. The resulting permissions are the intersection of entity's identity-based policies and its permissions boundaries. Resource-based policies that specify the user or role in the Principal field are not limited by the permissions boundary. An explicit deny in any of these policies overrides the allow. For more information about permissions boundaries, see Permissions boundaries for IAM entities in the IAM User Guide.\n\nService control policies (SCPs) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 SCPs are JSON policies that specify the maximum permissions for an organization or organizational unit (OU) in AWS Organizations. AWS Organizations is a service for grouping and centrally managing multiple AWS accounts that your business owns. If you enable all features in an organization, then you can apply service control policies (SCPs) to any or all of your accounts. The SCP limits permissions for entities in member accounts, including each AWS account root user. For more information about Organizations and SCPs, see How SCPs work in the AWS Organizations User Guide.\n\nSession policies \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Session policies are advanced policies that you pass as a parameter when you programmatically create a temporary session for a role or federated user. The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the user or role's identity-based policies and the session policies. Permissions can also come from a resource-based policy. An explicit deny in any of these policies overrides the allow. For more information, see Session policies in the IAM User Guide.",

These policies are already available in your account and are maintained and updated by AWS. For more information, see Get started using permissions with AWS managed policies in the IAM User Guide.\n\nGrant least privilege \u00e2\u0080\u0093 When you create custom policies, grant only the permissions required to perform a task. Start with a minimum set of permissions and grant additional permissions as necessary. Doing so is more secure than starting with permissions that are too lenient and then trying to tighten them later. For more information, see Grant least privilege in the IAM User Guide.\n\nEnable MFA for sensitive operations \u00e2\u0080\u0093 For extra security, require IAM users to use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to access sensitive resources or API operations. For more information, see Using multi-factor authentication (MFA) in AWS in the IAM User Guide.\n\nUse policy conditions for extra security \u00e2\u0080\u0093 To the extent that it's practical, define the conditions under which your identity-based policies allow access to a resource. For example, you can write conditions to specify a range of allowable IP addresses that a request must come from. You can also write conditions to allow requests only within a specified date or time range, or to require the use of SSL or MFA. For more information, see IAM JSON policy elements: Condition in the IAM User Guide.",
