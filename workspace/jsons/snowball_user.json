Sign in as the root user only to perform a few account and service management tasks.\n\nIn the navigation pane, choose Users and then choose Add users.\n\nFor User name, enter Administrator.\n\nSelect the check box next to AWS Management Console access. Then select Custom password, and then enter your new password in the text box.\n\n(Optional) By default, AWS requires the new user to create a new password when first signing in. You can clear the check box next to User must create a new password at next sign-in to allow the new user to reset their password after they sign in.\n\nChoose Next: Permissions.\n\nUnder Set permissions, choose Add user to group.\n\nChoose Create group.\n\nIn the Create group dialog box, for Group name enter Administrators.\n\nChoose Filter policies, and then select AWS managed - job function to filter the table contents.\n\nIn the policy list, select the check box for AdministratorAccess. Then choose Create group.\nNoteYou must activate IAM user and role access to Billing before you can use the AdministratorAccess permissions to access the AWS Billing and Cost Management console. To do this, follow the instructions in step 1 of the tutorial about delegating access to the billing console.\n\nBack in the list of groups, select the check box for your new group. Choose Refresh if necessary to see the group in the list.\n\nChoose Next: Tags.\n\n(Optional) Add metadata to the user by attaching tags as key-value pairs. For more information about using tags in IAM, see Tagging IAM entities in the IAM User Guide.\n\nChoose Next: Review to see the list of group memberships to be added to the new user.

Instead, contact AWS Support, and a new Snowball will be shipped to you.\n\nWe recommend that you don't save a copy of the unlock code in the same location in the workstation as the manifest for that job. Saving the unlock code and manifest separately helps prevent unauthorized parties from gaining access to the Snowball. For example, you might take this approach: First, save a copy of the manifest to the workstation. Then, email the unlock code to the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user to perform the data transfer from the workstation. This approach limits access to the Snowball to individuals who have access to files saved on the workstation and also that IAM user's email address.\n\nWhenever you transfer data between your on-premises data centers and a Snowball, logs are automatically generated and saved to your workstation. These logs are saved in plaintext format and can contain file name and path information for the files that you transfer. To protect this potentially sensitive information, we strongly suggest that you delete these logs after the job that the logs are associated with enters Completed status.

"text": "Use the latest Mac or Linux Snowball client \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The latest Snowball clients for Mac and Linux both support the Advanced Encryption Standard New Instructions (AES-NI) extension to the x86 instruction set architecture. This extension offers improved speeds for encrypting or decrypting data during transfers between the Snowball and your Mac or Linux workstations. For more information on AES-NI, including supported hardware, see AES instruction set on Wikipedia.\n\nBatch small files together \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Each copy operation has some overhead because of encryption. Therefore, performing many transfers on individual files has slower overall performance than transferring the same data in larger files. You can significantly improve your transfer speed for small files by batching them in a single snowball cp command. During the import process into Amazon S3, these batched files are automatically extracted to their original state. For more information, see Options for the snowball cp Command.\n\nPerform multiple copy operations at one time \u00e2\u0080\u0093 If your workstation is powerful enough, you can perform multiple snowball cp commands at one time. You can do this by running each command from a separate terminal window, in separate instances of the Snowball client, all connected to the same Snowball.\n\nCopy from multiple workstations \u00e2\u0080\u0093 You can connect a single Snowball to multiple workstations. Each workstation can host a separate instance of the Snowball client.\n\nTransfer directories, not files \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Because there is overhead for each snowball cp command, we don't recommend that you queue a large number of individual copy commands. Queuing many commands has a significant negative impact on your transfer performance.\nFor example, say that you have a directory called C:\\\\MyFiles that only contains three files, file1.txt, file2.txt, and file3.txt. Suppose that you issue the following three commands.\nsnowball cp C:\\\\MyFiles\\file1.txt s3://mybucket\nsnowball cp C:\\\\MyFiles\\file2.txt s3://mybucket\nsnowball cp C:\\\\MyFiles\\file3.txt s3://mybucket\n\nIn this scenario, you have three times as much overhead as if you transferred the entire directory with the following copy command.\nSnowball cp \u00e2\u0080\u0093r C:\\\\MyFiles\\* s3://mybucket\n\nDon't perform other operations on files during transfer \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Renaming files during transfer, changing their metadata, or writing data to the files during a copy operation has a significant negative impact on transfer performance. We recommend that your files remain in a static state while you transfer them. Reduce local network use \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Your Snowball communicates across your local network. Because of this, reducing other local network traffic between the Snowball, the switch it's connected to, and the workstation that hosts your data source can improve data transfer speeds.\n\nEliminate unnecessary hops \u00e2\u0080\u0093 We recommend that you set up your Snowball, your data source, and your workstation so that they're the only machines communicating across a single switch. Doing so can result in a significant improvement of data transfer speeds.",

"text": "To authenticate the Snowball client's access to a Snowball\nObtain your manifest and unlock code.\n\nGet the manifest from the AWS Snow Family Management Console or the job management API. Your manifest is encrypted so that only the unlock code can decrypt it. The Snowball client compares the decrypted manifest against the information that was put in the Snowball when it was being prepared. This comparison verifies that you have the right Snowball for the data transfer job you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re about to begin. Get the unlock code, a 29-character code that also appears when you download your manifest. We recommend that you write it down and keep it in a separate location from the manifest that you downloaded, to prevent unauthorized access to the Snowball while it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at your facility. Locate the IP address for the Snowball on the Snowball's E Ink display. When the Snowball is connected to your network for the first time, it automatically creates a DHCP IP address. If you want to use a different IP address, you can change it from the E Ink display. For more information, see Using an AWS Snowball Device.\n\nExecute the snowball start command to authenticate your access to the Snowball with the Snowball's IP address and your credentials, as follows:\nsnowball start -i [IP Address] -m [Path/to/manifest/file] -u [29 character unlock code]\nsnowball start -i 192.0.2.0 -m /user/tmp/manifest -u 01234-abcde-01234-ABCDE-01234",

"text": "Resource\nDescription\nHow to Control Access AWS Snow Family Management Console\nThe AWS Snow Family Management Console is where you create and manage your data transfers between your on-premises data centers and Amazon S3 using discrete units of work called jobs. To access the console, see AWS Snow Family Management Console.\nYou can control access to this resource by creating or managing your IAM users. For more information, see Creating an IAM User for Snowball. Amazon S3 buckets\nAll data in Amazon S3 is stored in units called objects. Objects are stored in containers called buckets. Any data that goes into Amazon S3 must be stored in a bucket.\nTo import data into an Amazon S3 bucket, the IAM user that created the import job must have read and write access to your Amazon S3 buckets. For more information on granting a user access to an Amazon S3 bucket, see How Amazon S3 Authorizes a Request for a Bucket Operation and Example 1: Bucket Owner Granting Its Users Bucket Permissions in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide. Snowball\nA Snowball is a storage device that is physically rugged, protected by AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS), and owned by Amazon. In the AWS Snowball service, all data transfers between Amazon S3 and your on-premises data center is done through a Snowball. You can only access a Snowball through the Snowball client, the data transfer tool. For you to access a Snowball, it must be connected to a physical workstation that has the Snowball client installed on it in your on-premises data center. With the Snowball client, you can access the Snowball by providing the job manifest and unlock code in the command that the Snowball client uses to start communication with the Snowball.\nYou can control access to the Snowball by careful distribution of a job's manifest and unlock code. Manifest\nThe manifest is an encrypted file that you can download from the AWS Snow Family Management Console after your job enters the Processing status. The manifest is decrypted by the unlock code, when you pass both values to the Snowball through the Snowball client when the client is started for the first time.\nAs a best practice, we recommend that you don't save a copy of the unlock code in the same location as the manifest for that job. Saving these separately helps prevent unauthorized parties from gaining access to the Snowball associated with that job. For example, you might save a copy of the manifest to the workstation, and email the code to the IAM user to perform the data transfer from the workstation. This approach limits those who can access the Snowball to individuals who have access to files saved on the workstation and also that IAM user's email address. Unlock code\nThe unlock code is a 29-character code with 25 alphanumeric characters and 4 hyphens. This code decrypts the manifest when it is passed along with the manifest to the Snowball through the Snowball client when the client is started for the first time. You can see the unlock code in the AWS Snow Family Management Console after your job enters the Preparing Snowball status. The code also appears in the dialog box when you download the manifest for a job. The unlock code appears on-screen only and is not downloaded.\nAgain, as a best practice we recommend that you don't save a copy of the unlock code in the same location as the manifest for that job. Saving these separately helps prevent unauthorized parties from gaining access to the Snowball associated with that job.

This file, saved to /.aws/snowball/config, has a value named auth.enabled set to true by default. If you change this value to false, you disable signing through the Signature Version 4 algorithm. You might not want to disable signing, because signing is used to prevent modifications or changes to data traveling between the adapter and your data storage. You can also enable HTTPS and provide your own certificate when communicating with the adapter. To do so, you start the adapter with additional options.

Put your data in those subdirectories.\n\nFor security purposes, data transfers must be completed within 90 days of the Snowball being prepared. After 90 days, the Snowball becomes locked to additional on-premises data transfers. If the Snowball becomes locked during a data transfer, return the Snowball and create a new job to transfer the rest of your data. If the Snowball becomes locked during an import job, we can still transfer the existing data on the Snowball into Amazon S3.\n\nObjects transferred onto Snowballs have a maximum key length of 933 bytes. Key names that include characters that take up more than one byte each still have a maximum key length of 933 bytes. When determining key length, you include the file or object name and also its path or prefixes. Thus, files with short file names within a heavily nested path can have keys longer than 933 bytes. The bucket name is not factored into the path when determining the key length. Some examples follow.

If your workstation runs out of memory as it runs the Snowball client, you see a Java OutOfMemoryError exception returned in the terminal window. You can resolve this issue by freeing up resources on the workstation or increasing the amount of memory for your workstation, and then performing your Snowball client task again.\n\nIf you encounter issues while transferring data to a Snowball using the client on a PC running Microsoft Windows Server, it might be due to the Data Deduplication feature in Windows. If you have the Data Deduplication feature turned on, we recommend that you use the Amazon S3 Adapter for Snowball with the AWS CLI to transfer data instead.
