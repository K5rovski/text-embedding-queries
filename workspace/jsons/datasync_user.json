Doing so can free up on-premises storage capacity and shut down legacy systems. Data protection \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Move data into any Amazon S3 storage class, choosing the most cost-effective storage class for your needs. You can also send data to Amazon EFS, FSx for Windows File Server, FSx for Lustre, or FSx for OpenZFS for a standby file system.\n\nData movement for timely in-cloud processing \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Move data in to or out of AWS for processing when working with systems that generate data on-premises. This approach can speed up critical hybrid cloud workflows across many industries.

"text": "Simplify and automate data movement \u00e2\u0080\u0093 DataSync makes it easier to move data over the network between on-premises storage and AWS storage services, and also between AWS storage services. DataSync automates both the management of data-transfer processes and the infrastructure required for high performance and secure data transfer.\n\nTransfer data securely \u00e2\u0080\u0093 DataSync provides end-to-end security, including encryption and integrity validation, to help ensure that your data arrives securely, intact, and ready to use. DataSync accesses your AWS storage through built-in AWS security mechanisms, such as AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles. It also supports virtual private cloud (VPC) endpoints, giving you the option to transfer data without traversing the public internet, and further increasing the security of data copied online.\n\nMove data faster \u00e2\u0080\u0093 With DataSync, you can transfer data rapidly over the network into AWS. It uses a purpose-built network protocol and a parallel, multi-threaded architecture to accelerate your transfers. This approach speeds up migrations, recurring data-processing workflows for analytics and machine learning, and data-protection processes.\n\nReduce operational costs \u00e2\u0080\u0093 You can move data cost-effectively with the flat, per-gigabyte pricing of DataSync. You can save on script development, and deployment and maintenance costs, and avoid the need for costly commercial transfer tools.",

You also need a VMware vSphere client to connect to the host. \nNote When VMware ends general support for an ESXi hypervisor version, DataSync also ends support for that version. For information about VMware's supported hypervisor versions, see VMware lifecycle policy on the VMware website. Microsoft Hyper-V Hypervisor (version 2012 R2, 2016, or 2019): A free, standalone version of Hyper-V is available at the Microsoft Download Center. For this setup, you need a Microsoft Hyper-V Manager on a Microsoft Windows client computer to connect to the host.\nNoteThe DataSync VM is a generation 1 virtual machine. For more information about the differences between generation 1 and generation 2 VMs, see Should I create a generation 1 or 2 virtual machine in Hyper-V? Linux Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM): A free, open-source virtualization technology. KVM is included in Linux versions 2.6.20 and newer. AWS DataSync is tested and supported for the CentOS/RHEL 7.8, Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS distributions. Any other modern Linux distribution might work, but function or performance is not guaranteed. We recommend this option if you already have a KVM environment up and running and you're already familiar with how KVM works.\nNoteRunning KVM on Amazon EC2 isn't supported, and cannot be used for DataSync agents. To run the agent on Amazon EC2, deploy an agent Amazon Machine Image (AMI). For more information about deploying an agent AMI on Amazon EC2, see Deploy your agent as an Amazon EC2 instance.\n\nAmazon EC2 instance: DataSync provides an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that contains the DataSync VM image.

For example, deploy your agent in the Availability Zone where your self-managed file system resides.To learn more about data transfer prices for all AWS Regions, see Amazon EC2 On-Demand pricing. \nFrom the AWS account where the source file system resides, launch the agent using your AMI from the Amazon EC2 launch wizard. Use the following URL to launch the AMI.\nhttps://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=source-file-system-region#LaunchInstanceWizard:ami=ami-id\nIn the URL, replace the source-file-system-region and ami-id with your own source AWS Region and AMI ID. The Choose an Instance Type page appears on the Amazon EC2 console. To find the DataSync AMI ID for a specified AWS Region, use the .AMI-command CLI command described in the preceding section.\n\nChoose one of the recommended instance types for your use case, and choose Next: Configure Instance Details. For the recommended instance types, see Amazon EC2 instance requirements.\n\nOn the Configure Instance Details page, do the following:\n\nFor Network, choose the virtual private cloud (VPC) where your source Amazon EFS or NFS file system is located.\n\nFor Auto-assign Public IP, choose a value. For your instance to be accessible from the public internet, set Auto-assign Public IP to Enable. Otherwise, set Auto-assign Public IP to Disable. If a public IP address isn't assigned, activate the agent in your VPC using its private IP address.\nWhen you transfer files from an in-cloud file system, to increase performance we recommend that you choose a Placement Group value where your NFS server resides. Choose Next: Add Storage. The agent doesn't require additional storage, so you can skip this step and choose Next: Add tags.\n\n(Optional) On the Add Tags page, you can add tags to your Amazon EC2 instance. When you're finished on the page, choose Next: Configure Security Group.\n\nOn the Configure Security Group page, do the following:\n\nMake sure that the selected security group allows inbound access to HTTP port 80 from the web browser that you plan to use to activate the agent.\n\nMake sure that the security group of the source file system allows inbound traffic from the agent. In addition, make sure that the agent allows outbound traffic to the source file system. If you deploy your agent using a VPC endpoint, you need to allow additional ports. For more information, see How DataSync works with VPC endpoints .\n\nFor the complete set of network requirements for DataSync, see Network requirements.\n\nChoose Review and Launch to review your configuration, then choose Launch to launch your instance. Remember to use a key pair that's accessible to you. A confirmation page appears and indicates that your instance is launching.\n\nChoose View Instances to close the confirmation page and return to the Amazon EC2 instances screen. When you launch an instance, its initial state is pending. After the instance starts, its state changes to running. At this point, it's assigned a public Domain Name System (DNS) name and IP address, you can find these in the Descriptions tab.\n\nIf you set Auto-assign Public IP to Enable, choose your instance and note the public IP address in the Description tab. You use this IP address later to connect to your sync agent. \nIf you set Auto-assign Public IP to Disable, launch or use an existing instance in your VPC to activate the agent. In this case, you use the private IP address of the sync agent to activate the agent from this instance in the VPC.",

"text": "To create an agent to read from a Network File System (NFS), Server Message Block (SMB), Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), or self-managed object storage source location\nDownload the current DataSync .ova image or launch the current DataSync Amazon Machine Image (AMI) based on Amazon EC2 from the AWS DataSync console. For information about how to get the .ova image or Amazon EC2 AMI, see Create an agent. For information about hardware requirements and recommended Amazon EC2 instance types, see Virtual machine requirements.\nImportantIf you are deploying your agent on Amazon EC2, deploy the agent so that it doesn't require network traffic between Availability Zones (to avoid charges for such traffic).\n\nTo access your Amazon EFS or Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system, deploy the agent in an Availability Zone that has a mount target to your file system.\n\nFor self-managed file systems, deploy the agent in the Availability Zone where your file system resides.\nTo learn more about data-transfer prices for all AWS Regions, see Amazon EC2 On-Demand pricing. Make sure that you satisfy the network-connectivity requirements for the agent. For information about network requirements, see Network requirements.\n\nDeploy the .ova image in your hypervisor, power on the hypervisor, and note the agent's IP address. Make sure that you can reach the agent on port 80. You can use the following command to check.\nnc -vz agent-ip-address 80\nNoteThe .ova default credentials are login admin, password password. You can change the password on the virtual machine (VM) local console. You don't need to log in to the VM for basic DataSync functionality. Logging in is required mainly for troubleshooting, network-specific settings, and so on.You log in to the agent VM local console by using your VM's hypervisor client. For information about how to use the VM local console, see Working with your DataSync agent's local console.\n\nSend an HTTP/1.1 GET request to the agent to get the activation key. You can do this by using standard Unix tools: To activate an agent by using a public service endpoint, use the following command.\ncurl \"http://agent-ip-address/?gatewayType=SYNC&activationRegion=aws-region&no_redirect\"\n\nTo activate an agent by using a virtual private cloud (VPC) endpoint, use the IP address of the VPC endpoint. Use the following command.\ncurl \"http://agent-ip-address/?gatewayType=SYNC&activationRegion=aws-region&privateLinkEndpoint=IP address of VPC endpoint&endpointType=PRIVATE_LINK&no_redirect\"\nTo find the correct IP address, open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/ and choose Endpoints from the navigation pane at left. Choose the DataSync endpoint, and check Subnets list to find the private IP address that corresponds to the subnet that you chose for your VPC endpoint setup.\nFor more information about VPC endpoint configuration, see step 5 in Configuring DataSync to use private IP addresses for data transfer.\n\nTo activate an agent using a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) endpoint, specify endpointType=FIPS. Also, the activationRegion value must be set to an AWS Region within the United States. To activate a FIPS endpoint, use the following command. \ncurl \"http://agent-IP-address/?gatewayType=SYNC&activationRegion=US-based-aws-region&endpointType=FIPS&no_redirect\"\n\nThis command returns an activation key similar to the one following.\nF0EFT-7FPPR-GG7MC-3I9R3-27DOH\n\nAfter you have the activation key, do one of the following: To activate your agent using a public endpoint or FIPS endpoint, use the following command.\naws datasync create-agent \\ --agent-name agent-name \\ --activation-key obtained-activation-key\n\nTo activate your agent using a VPC endpoint, use the following command.\naws datasync create-agent \\ --agent-name agent-name \\ --vpc-endpoint-id vpc-endpoint-id \\ --subnet-arns subnet-arns \\ --security-group-arns security-group-arns \\ --activation-key obtained-activation-key\nIn this command, use the following arguments: vpc-endpoint-id \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The AWS endpoint that the agent connects to. To find the endpoint ID, open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/, and choose Endpoints from the navigation pane on the left. Copy the Endpoint ID value of the DataSync endpoint. For more information about VPC endpoint configuration, see step 5 in Configuring DataSync to use private IP addresses for data transfer.\n\nsecurity-group-arn \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the security groups to use for the task's endpoint.\nThis is the security group that you created in step 3 of Configuring DataSync to use private IP addresses for data transfer.\n\nsubnet-arns \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The ARNs of the subnets where the task endpoints for the agent are created.\nThis is the subnet that you chose in step 1 of Configuring DataSync to use private IP addresses for data transfer.\n\nThese commands return the ARN of the agent that you just activated. The ARN is similar to the one following.\n{ \"AgentArn\": \"arn:aws:datasync:us-east-1:111222333444:agent/agent-0b0addbeef44baca3\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n}\nNoteAfter you choose a service endpoint, you can't change it later.",

Other NFS clients in your network must be able to mount this path. To see all the paths exported by your NFS server, run the command showmount -e nfs-server-address from an NFS client with access to your server. You can specify any directory that appears in the results, and any subdirectory of that directory. To transfer all the data in the folder that you specified, DataSync needs permissions to read all the data. To give DataSync permissions, you can do one of two things. You can configure the NFS export with no_root_squash. Or, for the all files that you want DataSync to access, you can make sure that the permissions allow read access for all users. Doing either enables the agent to read the files. For the agent to access directories, you must additionally give all users execute access.\n\nMake sure that the NFS export path is accessible without Kerberos authentication.\n\nDataSync automatically chooses the NFS version that it uses to read from an NFS location.

"text": "To create an Amazon EFS location by using the CLI\nIf you don't have an Amazon EFS file system, create one. For information about how to create an EFS file system, see Getting started with Amazon Elastic File System in the Amazon Elastic File System User Guide.\n\nIdentify a subnet that has at least one mount target for that file system. You can see all the mount targets and the subnets associated with an EFS file system by using the describe-mount-targets command.\naws efs describe-mount-targets \\ --region aws-region  \\ --file-system-id file-system-id\nNoteThe AWS Region that you specify is the one where your target S3 bucket or EFS file system is located.\nThis command returns information about the target similar to the information shown following.\n{ \"MountTargets\": [ { \"OwnerId\": \"111222333444\", \"MountTargetId\": \"fsmt-22334a10\", \"FileSystemId\": \"fs-123456ab\", \"SubnetId\": \"subnet-f12a0e34\", \"LifeCycleState\": \"available\", \"IpAddress\": \"11.222.0.123\", \"NetworkInterfaceId\": \"eni-1234a044\" } ]\n} Specify an Amazon EC2 security group that can be used to access the mount target. You can run the following command to find out the security group of the mount target.\naws efs describe-mount-target-security-groups \\ --region aws-region \\ --mount-target-id mount-target-id\nThe security group that you provide must be able to communicate with the security group on the mount target in the subnet specified. \nThe relationship between security group M on the mount target and security group S, which you provide for DataSync to use at this stage, is as follows: Security group M, which you associate with the mount target, must allow inbound access for the TCP protocol on the NFS port (2049) from security group S.\nYou can enable an inbound connection either by its IP address (CIDR range) or its security group.\n\nSecurity group S, which you provide to DataSync to access Amazon EFS, should have a rule that enables outbound connections to the NFS port. It enables outbound connections on one of the file system's mount targets.\nYou can enable outbound connections either by IP address (CIDR range) or security group.\nFor information about security groups and mount targets, see Security groups for Amazon EC2 instances and mount targets in the Amazon Elastic File System User Guide. Create the EFS location. To create the EFS location, you need the ARNs for your Amazon EC2 subnet, Amazon EC2 security group, and an EFS file system. Because the DataSync API accepts fully qualified ARNs, you can construct these ARNs. For information about how to construct ARNs for different services, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in the AWS General Reference. \nUse the following command to create an EFS location.\naws datasync create-location-efs \\ --subdirectory /path/to/your/subdirectory \\ --efs-filesystem-arn 'arn:aws:elasticfilesystem:region:account-id:file-system/filesystem-id' \\ --ec2-config SecurityGroupArns='arn:aws:ec2:region:account-id:security-group/security-group-id',SubnetArn='arn:aws:ec2:region:account-id:subnet/subnet-id'",

For instructions on how to attach the policy, see Allowing DataSync to upload logs to Amazon CloudWatch log groups. Create a task by using the following command.\naws datasync create-task \\ --source-location-arn 'arn:aws:datasync:region:account-id:location/location-id' \\ --destination-location-arn 'arn:aws:datasync:region:account-id:location/location-id' \\ --cloud-watch-log-group-arn 'arn:aws:logs:region:account-id:log-group:log-group' \\ --name task-name\nThis command returns the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a task, similar to the one shown following.\n{ \"TaskArn\": \"arn:aws:datasync:us-east-1:111222333444:task/task-08de6e6697796f026\" \n}\nWhen creating a task that transfers data between AWS services in different Regions, and the other location needs to be specified in a different Region (for example, to transfer data between us-east-1 and us-east-2), use DataSync in one of the Regions and create a task by using the following command.\nYou can transfer data between AWS Regions, except for the  China Regions and the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions. You can also transfer data between the AWS GovCloud (US-East) and AWS GovCloud (US-West) Regions. \naws datasync create-task \\ --source-location-arn 'arn:aws:datasync:us-east-1:account-id:location/location-id \\ --destination-location-arn 'arn:aws:datasync:us-east-2:account-id:location/location-id \\ --cloud-watch-log-group-arn 'arn:aws:logs:region:account-id' \\ --name task-name \\ --options VerifyMode=NONE,OverwriteMode=NEVER,Atime=BEST_EFFORT,Mtime=PRESERVE,Uid=INT_VALUE,Gid=INT_VALUE,PreserveDevices=PRESERVE,PosixPermissions=PRESERVE,PreserveDeletedFiles=PRESERVE,TaskQueueing=ENABLED,LogLevel=TRANSFER\nYour task is created with the default configuration options. If you want to configure different options as part of your task creation, add the --options parameter to your create-task command. The following example shows how to specify different options. For a description of these options, see Options. \naws datasync create-task \\ --source-location-arn 'arn:aws:datasync:region:account-id:location/location-id' \\ --destination-location-arn 'arn:aws:datasync:region:account-id:location/location-id' \\ --cloud-watch-log-group-arn 'arn:aws:logs:region:account-id:log-group:log-group' \\ --name task-name \\ --options VerifyMode=NONE,OverwriteMode=NEVER,Atime=BEST_EFFORT,Mtime=PRESERVE,Uid=INT_VALUE,Gid=INT_VALUE,PreserveDevices=PRESERVE,PosixPermissions=PRESERVE,PreserveDeletedFiles=PRESERVE,TaskQueueing=ENABLED,LogLevel=TRANSFER\nWhen you create a task, you can configure the task to include or exclude specific files, folders, and objects. For more information, see Filtering the data transferred by DataSync. You can also schedule when you want your task to run. For more information, see Scheduling your DataSync task.\nNoteIf a task remains in the CREATING status for more than a few minutes, your agent might be having trouble reaching your self-managed storage. Check the task's ErrorCode and ErrorDetail values. For example, NFS and SMB mount issues are often caused by a mistyped server hostname, or when the agent's access to your storage is blocked by firewall rules.",

"text": "To configure a DataSync agent and task to communicate with AWS by using VPC endpoints\nChoose the VPC and subnet where you want to set up the DataSync private IP addresses. \nThe VPC should extend to your local environment, where your SMB, NFS, or self-managed object storage is located, by using routing rules over AWS Direct Connect or VPN. This setup ensures that all communications between the DataSync agent and the DataSync service remain within the VPC. Deploy a DataSync agent close to your local storage. The agent must be able to access your source storage location by using NFS, SMB, or the Amazon S3 API. You can download the .ova file for the DataSync agent from the DataSync console. The agent doesn't need a public IP address. For more information about downloading and deploying an .ova image, see Creating an agent. \nNoteYou can use one agent for only one type of endpoint\u00e2\u0080\u0094private, public, or Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS). If you already have an agent configured for transferring data over the public internet, deploy a new agent to transfer data to private DataSync endpoints. For detailed instructions, see Deploy your DataSync agent. In the VPC that you chose in step 1, create a security group to ensure access to the private IP addresses that DataSync uses. These addresses include one VPC endpoint for control traffic and four elastic network interfaces (ENIs)  to use for data transfer. You use this security group to manage access to these private IP addresses and ensure that your agent can route to them. \nThe agent must be able to establish connections to these IP addresses. In the security group attached to the endpoints, configure inbound rules to allow the agent's private IP address to connect to these endpoints. Create a VPC endpoint for the DataSync service. To do this, open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/, and choose Endpoints from the navigation pane at left. Choose Create Endpoint. \nFor Service category, choose AWS service. For Service Name, choose DataSync in your AWS Region (for example, com.amazonaws.us-east-1.datasync). Then choose the VPC and security group that you chose in steps 1 and 3. Make sure that you clear the Enable Private DNS Name check box. \nImportantIf you are using a DataSync Amazon EC2 agent, choose the Availability Zone where your agent resides to avoid charges for network traffic between Availability Zones.To learn more about data transfer prices for all AWS Regions, see Amazon EC2 On-Demand pricing. For additional details on creating VPC endpoints, see Creating an interface endpoint in Amazon VPC User Guide.\n\nWhen your new VPC endpoint becomes available, make sure that the network configuration for your self-managed environment allows agent activation. Activation is a one-time operation that securely associates the agent with your AWS account. To activate the agent, use a computer that can reach the agent by using port 80. After activation, this access can be revoked. The agent should be able to reach the private IP address of the VPC endpoint that you created in step 4. \nTo find this IP address, open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/, and choose Endpoints from the navigation pane at left. Choose the DataSync endpoint, and check the Subnets list for the private IP address for the subnet that you chose. This is the IP address of your VPC endpoint. \nNote Make sure to allow outbound traffic from the agent to the VPC endpoint by using ports 443, 1024\u00e2\u0080\u00931064, and port 22. Port 22 is optional and is used for the AWS Support channel. Activate the agent. If you have a computer that can route to the agent by using port 80 and that can access the DataSync console, open the console and choose Create Agent. In the service endpoint section, choose VPC endpoints using AWS PrivateLink. Choose the VPC endpoint from step 4, the subnet from step 1, and the security group from step 3. Enter the agent's IP address. \nIf you can't access the agent and the DataSync console using the same computer, activate the agent using the command line from a computer that can reach the agent's port 80. For more information, see Creating an agent. Choose Get Key, optionally enter an agent name and tags, and choose Create agent. Your new agent now appears on the Agents tab of the DataSync console. The green VPC Endpoint banner indicates that all tasks performed with this agent use private endpoints, without crossing the public internet. Create your task by configuring a source and a destination for your data transfer. For more information on choosing endpoints, see Choose a service endpoint. To make transfer easier by using private IP addresses, your task creates four ENIs in the VPC and subnet that you chose.\n\nMake sure that your agent can reach the four ENIs and related IP addresses that your task creates.\nTo find these IP addresses, open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/, and choose Network Interfaces on the dashboard. Enter the task ID into the search filter to see the task's four ENIs. These are the ENIs used by your VPC endpoint. Make sure that you allow outbound traffic from the agent to these interfaces by using port 443.",

If so, this is a subdirectory in the EFS file system that is used to read data from the EFS source or write data to the EFS destination. By default, DataSync uses the root directory. For Subnet and Security Group, DataSync automatically chooses a subnet that includes a mount target for your Amazon EFS file system and the subnet's default security group. We recommend using these default settings.\nNoteDataSync uses the security group specified in this step to connect to one of your Amazon EFS file system's mount targets on the Network File System (NFS) port (2049). This setup commonly works when:\n\nYour mount target uses the subnet's default security group.\n\nYour security group allows inbound port 2049 (or \"all\") traffic from network interfaces using the same security group.\nIf your mount targets or security group are configured differently than this, make sure that:\n\nThe specified subnet includes a mount target for your Amazon EFS file system.\n\nYour file system's mount target accepts inbound traffic on port 2049 from network interfaces using the specified security group.\nFor more information, see Using VPC security groups for Amazon EC2 instances and mount targets in the Amazon Elastic File System User Guide.\n\n(Optional) Provide values for the Key and Value fields to tag the EFS file system.

"text": "When you create an Amazon EFS file system in Bursting Throughput mode, you get an allocation of 2.1-TB worth of burst credits. All Amazon EFS file systems are able to burst up to 100 MB per second of throughput when using Bursting Throughput mode. File systems with more than 1 TiB of S3 Standard class storage can drive 100 MiB per second per TB when burst credits are available.\nDataSync consumes file system burst credits. This can have an impact on the performance of your applications. When using DataSync with a file system that has an active workload, consider using EFS Provisioned Throughput.\n\nAmazon EFS file systems that are in General Purpose performance mode have a limit of 35,000 file system operations per second. This limit can impact the maximum throughput DataSync can achieve when copying files.\nOperations that read data or metadata consume one file operation, and operations that write data or update metadata consume five file operations. This means that a file system can support 35,000 read operations per second, or 7,000 write operations, or some combination of the two. File operations are counted from all connecting clients. \nFor more information, see Amazon EFS performance in the Amazon Elastic File System User Guide.",

"text": "To create an Amazon FSx locationOpen the AWS DataSync console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/datasync/.\nIn the navigation pane, choose Locations. The locations that you previously created appear in the list of locations.\n\nChoose Create Location to open the Create location page. For Location type, choose Amazon FSx for Windows File Server.\n\nFor FSx for Windows File system, choose the FSx for Windows File Server that you want to use as an endpoint. You configure this location as a source or destination later.\n\nFor Share name, enter the mount path for your Amazon FSx file server. The path can include a subdirectory. If so, this is a subdirectory in the FSx for Windows File Server that's used to read data from the FSx location or write data to the Amazon FSx destination.\nNoteThe subdirectory must be specified with forward slashes (for example, //FSx.DNS/share/path/to/folder).\n\nFor Security Group, the DataSync console automatically chooses the default security group of the subnet for the chosen FSx for Windows File Server. We recommend using these default settings. \nNoteDataSync uses the security group specified in this step to connect to your FSx for Windows File Server. If the security group is configured to disallow connections from within itself, you have two options:\n\nChange the security group configuration to allow the security group to communicate within itself.\n\nChoose a different security group, so the selected security group can communicate with the mount target's security group. In the User settings section, provide the information for FSx for Windows File Server:\nUser\nThe user that can mount the location and has the permissions to access the Amazon FSx server. \nTo ensure sufficient permissions to files, folders, and file metadata, we recommend that you make this user a member of the file system administrators group. If you are using AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory with FSx for Windows File Server, the user must be a member of the AWS Delegated FSx Administrators group. If you are using a self-managed Microsoft Active Directory with your FSx for Windows File Server, the user must be a member of one of two groups. These are the group of Domain Admins or the custom group you specified for file system administration when you created your file system.\nTo set object ownership, DataSync requires the SE_RESTORE_NAME privilege, which is usually granted to members of the built-in Active Directory groups Backup Operators and Domain Admins. Providing a user to DataSync with this privilege also helps ensure sufficient permissions to files, folders, and file metadata except for NTFS system access control lists (SACLs). \nAdditional privileges are required to copy SACLs. Specifically, this requires the Windows SE_SECURITY_NAME privilege, which is granted to members of the Domain Admins group. If your task will be configured to copy SACLs, make sure that the user has the required privileges. To learn more about configuring a task to copy SACLs, see Ownership and permissions-related options. \nWhen you copy data between SMB shares and Amazon FSx, or between two Amazon FSx locations, both the source and the destination must belong to the same Active Directory domain, or have an Active Directory trust relationship between their domains.\nPassword\nThe password of the user that can mount the location and has the permissions to access files and folders in the FSx for Windows File Server. \nDomain\n(Optional) The name of the domain the FSx for Windows File Server belongs to.\n\n(Optional) Provide values for the Key and Value fields to tag the FSx for Windows File Server. A tag is a key-value pair that helps you manage, filter, and search for your locations. We recommend using tags to name your resources. When you are done, choose Create location.

When using object versioning, running a DataSync task once might create more than one version of an Amazon S3 object.\n\nDataSync requires access to your Amazon S3 bucket. To do this, DataSync assumes an IAM role that includes an IAM policy and security token service trust (STS) relationship. The policy determines which actions the role can perform. Let DataSync create the role for you or specify a role you created. For more information, see Manually configuring an IAM role to access your Amazon S3 bucket.\n\nIn addition to the IAM policies that grant DataSync permissions, we recommend creating a multipart upload bucket policy for your S3 buckets to help control your storage costs.

"text": "To deploy the DataSync agent as an Amazon EC2 instanceFrom the AWS account where the source EFS resides, launch the agent by using your Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from the Amazon EC2 launch wizard. Use the following URL to launch the AMI.\nhttps://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=source-efs-or-nfs-region#LaunchInstanceWizard:ami=ami-id\nIn the URL, replace the source-efs-or-nfs-region and ami-id with your own. \nAfter the AMI launches, the Choose an Instance Type appears on the Amazon EC2 console. For a list of AMI IDs by AWS Region, see Deploy your agent as an Amazon EC2 instance.\n\nChoose one of the recommended instance types for your use case, and choose Next: Configure Instance Details. For the recommended instance types, see Amazon EC2 instance requirements.\nOn the Configure Instance Details page, do the following:\nFor Network, choose the VPC where your source EFS or NFS is located.Choose a value for Auto-assign Public IP. If you want your instance to be accessible from the public internet, set Auto-assign Public IP to Enable. Otherwise, set Auto-assign Public IP to Disable. If a public IP address isn't assigned, activate the agent in your VPC using its private IP address.\nWhen you transfer files from an in-cloud NFS, to increase performance, we recommend that you choose the Placement Group where your NFS server resides.\n\nChoose Next: Add Storage. The agent doesn't require additional storage, so you can skip this step and choose Next: Add tags.(Optional) On the Add Tags page, you can add tags to your Amazon EC2 instance. When you're finished on the page, choose Next: Configure Security Group.\nOn the Configure Security Group page, do the following:\nMake sure that the selected security group allows inbound access to HTTP port 80 from the web browser that you plan to use to activate the agent.Make sure that the security group of source EFS or NFS allows inbound traffic from the agent. In addition, make sure that the agent allows outbound traffic to the source EFS or NFS. The traffic goes through the standard NFS port, 2049.\nFor the complete set of network requirements for DataSync, see Network requirements.\nChoose Review and Launch to review your configuration, then choose Launch to launch your instance. Remember to use a key pair that's accessible to you. A confirmation page appears and indicates that your instance is launching.Choose View Instances to close the confirmation page and return to the Amazon EC2 instances screen. When you launch an instance, its initial state is pending. After the instance starts, its state changes to running. At this point, it's assigned a public Domain Name System (DNS) name and IP address, which can be found in the Descriptions tab.If you set Auto-assign Public IP to Enable, choose your instance and note the public IP address in the Description tab. You use this IP address later to connect to your sync agent. \nIf you set Auto-assign Public IP to Disable, launch or use an existing instance in your VPC to activate the agent. In this case, you use the private IP address of the sync agent to activate the agent from this instance in the VPC.",

"text": "Filter The whole string that makes up a particular filter, for example: *.tmp|*.temp or /folderA|/folderB\nFilters are made up of patterns delimited with a | (pipe). A delimiter isn't needed when you add patterns on the console because you add each pattern separately.\n\nPattern A pattern within a filter. For example, *.tmp is a pattern that's part of the *.tmp|*.temp filter.\n\nFolders All filters are relative to the source location path. For example, suppose that you specify /my_source/ as the source path when you create your source location and task and specify the include filter /transfer_this/. In this case, DataSync transfers only the directory /my_source/transfer_this/ and its contents.To specify a folder directly under the source location, include a forward slash (/) in front of the folder name. In the example preceding, the pattern uses /transfer_this, not transfer_this.DataSync interprets the following patterns the same way and matches both the folder and its content.\n/dir\n\n/dir/When you are transferring data from or to an Amazon S3 bucket, DataSync treats the / character in the object key as the equivalent of a folder on a file system.\n\nSpecial characters\n\nFollowing are special characters for use with filtering. Special character\nDescription * (wildcard) A character used to match zero or more characters. For example, /movies_folder* matches both /movies_folder and /movies_folder1. | (pipe delimiter) A character used as a delimiter between patterns. It enables specifying multiple patterns, any of which can match the filter. For example, *.tmp|*.temp matches files ending with either tmp or temp.\nNoteThis delimiter isn't needed when you add patterns on the console because you add each pattern on a separate line. \\ (backslash) A character used for escaping special characters (*, |, \\) in a file or object name. \nA double backslash (\\\\) is required when a backslash is part of a file name. Similarly, \\\\\\\\ represents two consecutive backslashes in a file name. \nA backslash followed by a pipe (\\|) is required when a pipe is part of a file name.\nA backslash (\\) followed by any other character, or at the end of a pattern, is ignored.",

For more information, see Queueing task executions. LAUNCHING This is the first phase of a task execution if there is no other task running and using the same agent or if queueing isn't enabled. At this point, AWS DataSync is initializing the task execution. This status usually goes quickly, but can take up to a few minutes. PREPARING This is the second phase of a task execution. AWS DataSync is computing which files need to be transferred. The time that this phase takes is proportional to the number of files in the source location. It usually takes between a few minutes to a few hours, depending on both the source and destination file systems and the performance of these file systems. For more information, see Starting your DataSync task. TRANSFERRING This is the third phase of a task execution. DataSync is performing the actual transfer of your data to AWS. While the DataSync is transferring files, the number of bytes and files that are transferred is updated in real time. VERIFYING This is the fourth and optional phase of a task execution.

This verification ensures that the data in your destination is an exact copy of the data in your source location.

"text": "AWS account root user \u00e2\u0080\u0093 When you first create an AWS account, you begin with a single sign-in identity that has complete access to all AWS services and resources in the account. This identity is called the AWS account root user and is accessed by signing in with the email address and password that you used to create the account. We strongly recommend that you do not use the root user for your everyday tasks, even the administrative ones. Instead, adhere to the best practice of using the root user only to create your first IAM user. Then securely lock away the root user credentials and use them to perform only a few account and service management tasks. IAM user \u00e2\u0080\u0093 An IAM user is an identity within your AWS account that has specific custom permissions (for example, permissions to create a task in DataSync). You can use an IAM user name and password to sign in to secure AWS webpages like the AWS Management Console, AWS Discussion Forums, or the AWS Support Center.\nIn addition to a user name and password, you can also generate access keys for each user. You can use these keys when you access AWS services programmatically, either through one of the several SDKs or by using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI). The SDK and CLI tools use the access keys to cryptographically sign your request. If you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t use AWS tools, you must sign the request yourself. DataSync supports Signature Version 4, a protocol for authenticating inbound API requests. For more information about authenticating requests, see Signature Version 4 signing process in the AWS General Reference.\n\nIAM role \u00e2\u0080\u0093 An IAM role is an IAM identity that you can create in your account that has specific permissions. An IAM role is similar to an IAM user in that it is an AWS identity with permissions policies that determine what the identity can and cannot do in AWS. However, instead of being uniquely associated with one person, a role is intended to be assumable by anyone who needs it. Also, a role does not have standard long-term credentials such as a password or access keys associated with it. Instead, when you assume a role, it provides you with temporary security credentials for your role session. IAM roles with temporary credentials are useful in the following situations: Federated user access \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Instead of creating an IAM user, you can use existing identities from AWS Directory Service, your enterprise user directory, or a web identity provider. These are known as federated users. AWS assigns a role to a federated user when access is requested through an identity provider. For more information about federated users, see Federated users and roles in the IAM User Guide. AWS service access \u00e2\u0080\u0093 A service role is an IAM role that a service assumes to perform actions on your behalf. An IAM administrator can create, modify, and delete a service role from within IAM. For more information, see Creating a role to delegate permissions to an AWS service in the IAM User Guide. Applications running on Amazon EC2 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 You can use an IAM role to manage temporary credentials for applications that are running on an EC2 instance and making AWS CLI or AWS API requests. This is preferable to storing access keys within the EC2 instance. To assign an AWS role to an EC2 instance and make it available to all of its applications, you create an instance profile that is attached to the instance. An instance profile contains the role and enables programs that are running on the EC2 instance to get temporary credentials. For more information, see Using an IAM role to grant permissions to applications running on Amazon EC2 instances in the IAM User Guide.",

This value is the IP address or Domain Name Service (DNS) name of the NFS server. An agent that is installed on-premises uses this hostname to mount the NFS server in a network. \nIf you are copying data to or from your AWS Snowcone device, see NFS Server on AWS Snowcone for more information.\nNoteThis name must either be DNS-compliant or must be an IP version 4 (IPv4) address.\nType: String\nLength Constraints: Maximum length of 255.\nPattern: ^(([a-zA-Z0-9\\-]*[a-zA-Z0-9])\\.)*([A-Za-z0-9\\-]*[A-Za-z0-9])$\n\nRequired: Yes Subdirectory The subdirectory in the NFS file system that is used to read data from the NFS source location or write data to the NFS destination. The NFS path should be a path that's exported by the NFS server, or a subdirectory of that path. The path should be such that it can be mounted by other NFS clients in your network. \nTo see all the paths exported by your NFS server, run \"showmount -e nfs-server-name\" from an NFS client that has access to your server. You can specify any directory that appears in the results, and any subdirectory of that directory. Ensure that the NFS export is accessible without Kerberos authentication. \nTo transfer all the data in the folder you specified, DataSync needs to have permissions to read all the data. To ensure this, either configure the NFS export with no_root_squash, or ensure that the permissions for all of the files that you want DataSync allow read access for all users. Doing either enables the agent to read the files. For the agent to access directories, you must additionally enable all execute access.\nIf you are copying data to or from your AWS Snowcone device, see NFS Server on AWS Snowcone for more information.\nFor information about NFS export configuration, see 18.7.

This value is calculated during the PREPARING phase, before the TRANSFERRING phase. This value is the expected number of files to be transferred. It's calculated based on comparing the content of the source and destination locations and finding the delta that needs to be transferred. \nType: Long Excludes A list of filter rules that determines which files to exclude from a task. The list should contain a single filter string that consists of the patterns to exclude. The patterns are delimited by \"|\" (that is, a pipe), for example: \"/folder1|/folder2\" Type: Array of FilterRule objects\nArray Members: Minimum number of 0 items. Maximum number of 1 item. FilesTransferred The actual number of files that was transferred over the network. This value is calculated and updated on an ongoing basis during the TRANSFERRING phase. It's updated periodically when each file is read from the source and sent over the network. \nIf failures occur during a transfer, this value can be less than EstimatedFilesToTransfer. This value can also be greater than EstimatedFilesTransferred in some cases. This element is implementation-specific for some location types, so don't use it as an indicator for a correct file number or to monitor your task execution.\nType: Long Includes A list of filter rules that determines which files to include when running a task.

The NFS path should be a path that's exported by the NFS server, or a subdirectory of that path. The path should be such that it can be mounted by other NFS clients in your network.\nTo see all the paths exported by your NFS server, run \"showmount -e nfs-server-name\" from an NFS client that has access to your server. You can specify any directory that appears in the results, and any subdirectory of that directory. Ensure that the NFS export is accessible without Kerberos authentication. \nTo transfer all the data in the folder that you specified, DataSync must have permissions to read all the data. To ensure this, either configure the NFS export with no_root_squash, or ensure that the files you want DataSync to access have permissions that allow read access for all users. Doing either option enables the agent to read the files. For the agent to access directories, you must additionally enable all execute access.\nIf you are copying data to or from your AWS Snowcone device, see NFS Server on AWS Snowcone for more information.\nFor information about NFS export configuration, see 18.7.

For more information about what metadata is copied by DataSync, see Metadata Copied by DataSync. \nDefault value: PRESERVE.\nPRESERVE: Preserve POSIX-style permissions (recommended).\nNONE: Ignore permissions. \nNote AWS DataSync can preserve extant permissions of a source location.\nType: String\nValid Values: NONE | PRESERVE\n\nRequired: No PreserveDeletedFiles A value that specifies whether files in the destination that don't exist in the source file system should be preserved. This option can affect your storage cost. If your task deletes objects, you might incur minimum storage duration charges for certain storage classes. For detailed information, see Considerations when working with Amazon S3 storage classes in DataSync  in the AWS DataSync User Guide.\nDefault value: PRESERVE.\nPRESERVE: Ignore such destination files (recommended). \nREMOVE: Delete destination files that aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t present in the source.\nType: String\nValid Values: PRESERVE | REMOVE\n\nRequired: No PreserveDevices A value that determines whether AWS DataSync should preserve the metadata of block and character devices in the source file system, and re-create the files with that device name and metadata on the destination. DataSync does not copy the contents of such devices, only the name and metadata. \nNote AWS DataSync can't sync the actual contents of such devices, because they are nonterminal and don't return an end-of-file (EOF) marker.\nDefault value: NONE.\nNONE: Ignore special devices (recommended). \nPRESERVE: Preserve character and block device metadata. This option isn't currently supported for Amazon EFS. \nType: String\nValid Values: NONE | PRESERVE\n\nRequired: No SecurityDescriptorCopyFlags A value that determines which components of the SMB security descriptor are copied from source to destination objects. This value is only used for transfers between SMB and Amazon FSx for Windows File Server locations, or between two Amazon FSx for Windows File Server locations. For more information about how DataSync handles metadata, see How DataSync Handles Metadata and Special Files. Default value: OWNER_DACL.\n\nOWNER_DACL: For each copied object, DataSync copies the following metadata: Object owner.\n\nNTFS discretionary access control lists (DACLs), which determine whether to grant access to an object.\n\nWhen choosing this option, DataSync does NOT copy the NTFS system access control lists (SACLs), which are used by administrators to log attempts to access a secured object.\n\nOWNER_DACL_SACL: For each copied object, DataSync copies the following metadata: Object owner.\n\nNTFS discretionary access control lists (DACLs), which determine whether to grant access to an object.\n\nNTFS system access control lists (SACLs), which are used by administrators to log attempts to access a secured object.\n\nCopying SACLs requires granting additional permissions to the Windows user that DataSync uses to access your SMB location. For information about choosing a user that ensures sufficient permissions to files, folders, and metadata, see user.\n\nNONE: None of the SMB security descriptor components are copied. Destination objects are owned by the user that was provided for accessing the destination location. DACLs and SACLs are set based on the destination server\u00e2\u0080\u0099s configuration. Type: String\nValid Values: NONE | OWNER_DACL | OWNER_DACL_SACL\n\nRequired: No TaskQueueing A value that determines whether tasks should be queued before executing the tasks. If set to ENABLED, the tasks will be queued. The default is ENABLED.\nIf you use the same agent to run multiple tasks, you can enable the tasks to run in series. For more information, see Queueing task executions.\nType: String\nValid Values: ENABLED | DISABLED\n\nRequired: No TransferMode A value that determines whether DataSync transfers only the data and metadata that differ between the source and the destination location, or whether DataSync transfers all the content from the source, without comparing to the destination location. \nCHANGED: DataSync copies only data or metadata that is new or different content from the source location to the destination location.\nALL: DataSync copies all source location content to the destination, without comparing to existing content on the destination.\nType: String\nValid Values: CHANGED | ALL\n\nRequired: No Uid The POSIX user ID (UID) of the file's owner. This option should only be set for NFS, EFS, and S3 locations. To learn more about what metadata is copied by DataSync, see Metadata Copied by DataSync.\nDefault value: INT_VALUE. This preserves the integer value of the ID.\nINT_VALUE: Preserve the integer value of UID and group ID (GID) (recommended).\nNONE: Ignore UID and GID. \nType: String\nValid Values: NONE | INT_VALUE | NAME | BOTH\n\nRequired: No VerifyMode A value that determines whether a data integrity verification should be performed at the end of a task execution after all data and metadata have been transferred. For more information, see Configure task settings. Default value: POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT.\nONLY_FILES_TRANSFERRED (recommended): Perform verification only on files that were transferred. POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT: Scan the entire source and entire destination at the end of the transfer to verify that source and destination are fully synchronized. This option isn't supported when transferring to S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes.\nNONE: No additional verification is done at the end of the transfer, but all data transmissions are integrity-checked with checksum verification during the transfer.\nType: String\nValid Values: POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT | ONLY_FILES_TRANSFERRED | NONE\n\nRequired: No",
