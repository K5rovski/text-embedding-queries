"text": "Create an instance of the AmazonGlacierClient class (the client). \nYou need to specify an AWS Region where the vault resides. All operations you perform using this client apply to that AWS Region.\n\nInitiate an inventory retrieval job by executing the InitiateJob method.\nYou provide job information in an InitiateJobRequest object. Amazon S3 Glacier (S3 Glacier) returns a job ID in response. The response is available in an instance of the InitiateJobResponse class.\n\nAmazonGlacierClient client;\nclient = new AmazonGlacierClient(Amazon.RegionEndpoint.USWest2);\n\nInitiateJobRequest initJobRequest = new InitiateJobRequest()\n{ VaultName = vaultName, JobParameters = new JobParameters() { Type = \"inventory-retrieval\", SNSTopic = \"*** Provide Amazon SNS topic arn ***\", }\n};\nInitiateJobResponse initJobResponse = client.InitiateJob(initJobRequest);\nstring jobId = initJobResponse.JobId;\n\nWait for the job to complete.\nYou must wait until the job output is ready for you to download. If you have either set a notification configuration on the vault identifying an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic, or specified an Amazon SNS topic when you initiated a job, S3 Glacier sends a message to that topic after it completes the job. The code example given in the following section uses Amazon SNS for S3 Glacier to publish a message.\nYou can also poll S3 Glacier by calling the DescribeJob method to determine job completion status. Although using Amazon SNS topic for notification is the recommended approach. Download the job output (vault inventory data) by executing the GetJobOutput method.\nYou provide your account ID, vault name, and the job ID information by creating an instance of the GetJobOutputRequest class. If you don't provide an account ID, then the account ID associated with the credentials you provide to sign the request is assumed. For more information, see Using the AWS SDK for .NET with Amazon S3 Glacier. The output that S3 Glacier returns is available in the GetJobOutputResponse object. GetJobOutputRequest getJobOutputRequest = new GetJobOutputRequest()\n{ JobId = jobId, VaultName = vaultName\n}; GetJobOutputResponse getJobOutputResponse = client.GetJobOutput(getJobOutputRequest); \nusing (Stream webStream = getJobOutputResponse.Body)\n{ using (Stream fileToSave = File.OpenWrite(fileName)) { CopyStream(webStream, fileToSave); }\n}\n\nNoteFor information about the job related underlying REST API, see Job Operations.",

You can upload archives in parts. These parts can be uploaded independently, in any order, and in parallel. If a part upload fails, you only need to upload that part again and not the entire archive. You can use multipart upload for archives from 1 byte to about 40,000 GB in size. For more information, see Uploading Large Archives in Parts (Multipart Upload).",

"text": "Initiate Multipart Upload\n\nWhen you send a request to initiate a multipart upload, S3 Glacier returns a multipart upload ID, which is a unique identifier for your multipart upload. Any subsequent multipart upload operations require this ID. This ID doesn't expire for at least 24 hours after S3 Glacier completes the job. \nIn your request to start a multipart upload, specify the part size in number of bytes. Each part you upload, except the last part, must be this size.\nNoteYou don't need to know the overall archive size when using multipart uploads. This means that you can use multipart uploads in cases where you don't know the archive size when you start uploading the archive. You only need to decide the part size at the time you start the multipart upload.\nIn the initiate multipart upload request, you can also provide an optional archive description. Upload Parts\nFor each part upload request, you must include the multipart upload ID you obtained in step 1. In the request, you must also specify the content range, in bytes, identifying the position of the part in the final archive. S3 Glacier later uses the content range information to assemble the archive in proper sequence. Because you provide the content range for each part that you upload, it determines the part's position in the final assembly of the archive, and therefore you can upload parts in any order. You can also upload parts in parallel. If you upload a new part using the same content range as a previously uploaded part, the previously uploaded part is overwritten. Complete (or stop) Multipart Upload\nAfter uploading all the archive parts, you use the complete operation. Again, you must specify the upload ID in your request. S3 Glacier creates an archive by concatenating parts in ascending order based on the content range you provided. S3 Glacier response to a Complete Multipart Upload request includes an archive ID for the newly created archive. If you provided an optional archive description in the Initiate Multipart Upload request, S3 Glacier associates it with the assembled archive. After you successfully complete a multipart upload, you cannot refer to the multipart upload ID. That means you cannot access parts associated with the multipart upload ID.\nIf you stop a multipart upload, you cannot upload any more parts using that multipart upload ID. All storage consumed by any parts associated with the stopped multipart upload is freed. If any part uploads were in-progress, they can still succeed or fail even after stopped.",

"text": "To retrieve an archive\nInitiate an archive retrieval job.\n\nGet the ID of the archive that you want to retrieve. You can get the archive ID from an inventory of the vault. For more information, see Downloading a Vault Inventory in Amazon S3 Glacier. Initiate a job requesting S3 Glacier to prepare an entire archive or a portion of the archive for subsequent download by using the Initiate Job (POST jobs) operation. When you initiate a job, S3 Glacier returns a job ID in the response and runs the job asynchronously. (You cannot download the job output until after the job completes as described in Step 2.)\nImportantFor Standard retrievals only, a data retrieval policy can cause your initiate retrieval job request to fail with a PolicyEnforcedException exception. For more information about data retrieval policies, see Amazon S3 Glacier Data Retrieval Policies. For more information about the PolicyEnforcedException exception, see Error Responses.\nWhen required, you can restore large segments of the data stored in S3 Glacier. For example, you might want to restore data for a secondary copy. However, if you need to restore a large amount of data, keep in mind that S3 Glacier is designed for 35 random restore requests per pebibyte (PiB) stored per day. \nFor more information about restoring data from these storage classes, see Amazon S3 Storage Classes for Archiving Objects in the Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide.\n\nAfter the job completes, download the bytes using the Get Job Output (GET output) operation. \nYou can download all bytes or specify a byte range to download only a portion of the job output. For larger output, downloading the output in chunks helps in the event of a download failure, such as a network failure. If you get job output in a single request and there is a network failure, you have to restart downloading the output from the beginning. However, if you download the output in chunks, in the event of any failure, you need only restart the download of the smaller portion and not the entire output.",

For a working example, see Example 2: Retrieving an Archive Using the Low-Level API of the AWS SDK for .NET\u00e2\u0080\u0094Download Output in Chunks.",

"text": "AWS account root user \u00e2\u0080\u0093 When you first create an AWS account, you begin with a single sign-in identity that has complete access to all AWS services and resources in the account. This identity is called the AWS account root user and is accessed by signing in with the email address and password that you used to create the account. We strongly recommend that you do not use the root user for your everyday tasks, even the administrative ones. Instead, adhere to the best practice of using the root user only to create your first IAM user. Then securely lock away the root user credentials and use them to perform only a few account and service management tasks. IAM user \u00e2\u0080\u0093 An IAM user is an identity within your AWS account that has specific custom permissions (for example, permissions to create a vault in S3 Glacier). You can use an IAM user name and password to sign in to secure AWS webpages like the AWS Management Console, AWS Discussion Forums, or the AWS Support Center.\nIn addition to a user name and password, you can also generate access keys for each user. You can use these keys when you access AWS services programmatically, either through one of the several SDKs or by using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI). The SDK and CLI tools use the access keys to cryptographically sign your request. If you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t use AWS tools, you must sign the request yourself. S3 Glacier supports Signature Version 4, a protocol for authenticating inbound API requests. For more information about authenticating requests, see Signature Version 4 signing process in the AWS General Reference.\n\nIAM role \u00e2\u0080\u0093 An IAM role is an IAM identity that you can create in your account that has specific permissions. An IAM role is similar to an IAM user in that it is an AWS identity with permissions policies that determine what the identity can and cannot do in AWS. However, instead of being uniquely associated with one person, a role is intended to be assumable by anyone who needs it. Also, a role does not have standard long-term credentials such as a password or access keys associated with it. Instead, when you assume a role, it provides you with temporary security credentials for your role session. IAM roles with temporary credentials are useful in the following situations: Federated user access \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Instead of creating an IAM user, you can use existing identities from AWS Directory Service, your enterprise user directory, or a web identity provider. These are known as federated users. AWS assigns a role to a federated user when access is requested through an identity provider. For more information about federated users, see Federated users and roles in the IAM User Guide. AWS service access \u00e2\u0080\u0093 A service role is an IAM role that a service assumes to perform actions on your behalf. An IAM administrator can create, modify, and delete a service role from within IAM. For more information, see Creating a role to delegate permissions to an AWS service in the IAM User Guide. Applications running on Amazon EC2 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 You can use an IAM role to manage temporary credentials for applications that are running on an EC2 instance and making AWS CLI or AWS API requests. This is preferable to storing access keys within the EC2 instance. To assign an AWS role to an EC2 instance and make it available to all of its applications, you create an instance profile that is attached to the instance. An instance profile contains the role and enables programs that are running on the EC2 instance to get temporary credentials. For more information, see Using an IAM role to grant permissions to applications running on Amazon EC2 instances in the IAM User Guide.",

If the metric exceeds a given threshold, a notification is sent to an Amazon SNS topic or AWS Auto Scaling policy. CloudWatch alarms do not invoke actions because they are in a particular state. Rather the state must have changed and been maintained for a specified number of periods. For more information, see Monitoring Metrics with Amazon CloudWatch.\n\nAWS CloudTrail Logs\nCloudTrail provides a record of actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS service in S3 Glacier. CloudTrail captures all API calls for S3 Glacier as events, including calls from the S3 Glacier console and from code calls to the S3 Glacier APIs. For more information, see Logging Amazon S3 Glacier API Calls with AWS CloudTrail.\n\nAWS Trusted Advisor\nTrusted Advisor draws upon best practices learned from serving hundreds of thousands of AWS customers. Trusted Advisor inspects your AWS environment and then makes recommendations when opportunities exist to save money, improve system availability and performance, or help close security gaps. All AWS customers have access to five Trusted Advisor checks. Customers with a Business or Enterprise support plan can view all Trusted Advisor checks. \nFor more information, see AWS Trusted Advisor in the AWS Support User Guide.",

After the policy is locked, it can no longer be changed. Vault lock policies can help you comply with regulatory frameworks such as SEC17a-4 and HIPAA.\n\nSecurity and Compliance Quick Start Guides discuss architectural considerations and steps for deploying security- and compliance-focused baseline environments on AWS. Architecting for HIPAA Security and Compliance outlines how companies use AWS to help them meet HIPAA requirements.\n\nThe AWS Well-Architected Tool (AWS WA Tool)  is a service in the cloud that provides a consistent process for you to review and measure your architecture using AWS best practices. The AWS WA Tool provides recommendations for making your workloads more reliable, secure, efficient, and cost-effective.\n\nAWS Compliance Resources provide several different workbooks and guides that might apply to your industry and location.\n\nAWS Config can help you assess how well your resource configurations comply with internal practices, industry guidelines, and regulations.\n\nAWS Security Hub provides you with a comprehensive view of your security state within AWS and helps you check your compliance with security industry standards and best practices.",

Using a canonical form is necessary because S3 Glacier uses the same canonical form when it recalculates a signature to compare with the one you sent. Task 2: Create a String to Sign\nCreate a string that you will use as one of the input values to your cryptographic hash function. The string, called the string to sign, is a concatenation of the name of the hash algorithm, the request date, a credential scope string, and the canonicalized request from the previous task. The credential scope string itself is a concatenation of date, AWS Region, and service information. Task 3: Create a Signature\nCreate a signature for your request by using a cryptographic hash function that accepts two input strings: your string to sign and a derived key. The derived key is calculated by starting with your secret access key and using the credential scope string to create a series of hash-based message authentication codes (HMACs). Note that the hash function used in this signing step is not the tree-hash algorithm used in S3 Glacier APIs that upload data.",

"text": "For each 1 MB chunk of payload data, compute the SHA-256 hash. The last chunk of data can be less than 1 MB. For example, if you are uploading a 3.2 MB archive, you compute the SHA-256 hash values for each of the first three 1 MB chunks of data, and then compute the SHA-256 hash of the remaining 0.2 MB data. These hash values form the leaf nodes of the tree.\n\nBuild the next level of the tree. Concatenate two consecutive child node hash values and compute the SHA-256 hash of the concatenated hash values. This concatenation and generation of the SHA-256 hash produces a parent node for the two child nodes.\n\nWhen only one child node remains, you promote that hash value to the next level in the tree. Repeat step 2 until the resulting tree has a root. The root of the tree provides a hash of the entire archive and a root of the appropriate subtree provides the hash for the part in a multipart upload.",

However, the subsequent Complete Multipart Upload request will fail.\n\nRange does not align\u00e2\u0080\u0094The byte range value in the request does not align with the part size specified in the corresponding initiate request. For example, if you specify a part size of 4194304 bytes (4 MB), then 0 to 4194303 bytes (4 MB \u00e2\u0080\u00941) and 4194304 (4 MB) to 8388607 (8 MB \u00e2\u0080\u00941) are valid part ranges. However, if you set a range value of 2 MB to 6 MB, the range does not align with the part size and the upload will fail.",

"text": "Change\nDescription\nRelease Date Querying archives with SQL S3 Glacier now supports querying data archives with SQL. For more information, see Querying Archives with S3 Glacier Select.\nThe following APIs are updated accordingly: Describe Job (GET JobID)\n\nInitiate Job (POST jobs)\n\nList Jobs (GET jobs) November 29, 2017 Expedited and Bulk Data Retrievals S3 Glacier now supports Expedited and Bulk data retrievals in addition to Standard retrievals. For more information, see Archive Retrieval Options. November 21, 2016 Vault Lock S3 Glacier now supports Vault Lock, which allows you to easily deploy and enforce compliance controls on individual S3 Glacier vaults with a Vault Lock policy. For more information, see Amazon S3 Glacier Vault Lock and Amazon S3 Glacier Access Control with Vault Lock Policies. July 8, 2015 Vault tagging S3 Glacier now allows you to tag your S3 Glacier vaults for easier resource and cost management. Tags are labels that you can define and associate with your vaults, and using tags adds filtering capabilities to operations such as AWS cost reports. For more information, see Tagging Amazon S3 Glacier Resources and Tagging Your Amazon S3 Glacier Vaults. June 22, 2015 Vault access policies S3 Glacier now supports managing access to your individual S3 Glacier vaults by using vault access policies. You can now define an access policy directly on a vault, making it easier to grant vault access to users and business groups internal to your organization, as well as to your external business partners. For more information, see Amazon S3 Glacier Access Control with Vault Access Policies. April 27, 2015 Data retrieval policies and audit logging S3 Glacier now supports data retrieval policies and audit logging. Data retrieval policies allow you to easily set data retrieval limits and simplify data retrieval cost management. You can define your own data retrieval limits with a few clicks in the AWS console or by using the S3 Glacier API. For more information, see Amazon S3 Glacier Data Retrieval Policies.\nIn addition, S3 Glacier now supports audit logging with AWS CloudTrail, which records S3 Glacier API calls for your account and delivers the log files to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. For more information, see Logging Amazon S3 Glacier API Calls with AWS CloudTrail. December 11, 2014 Updates to Java samples Updated the Java code samples in this guide that use the AWS SDK for Java. June 27, 2014 Limiting vault inventory retrieval You can now limit the number of vault inventory items retrieved by filtering on the archive creation date or by setting a limit. For more information about limiting inventory retrieval, see Range Inventory Retrieval in the Initiate Job (POST jobs) topic. December 31, 2013 Removed outdated URLs Removed the URLs that pointed to the old security credentials page from code examples. July 26, 2013 Support for range retrievals S3 Glacier now supports retrieval of specific ranges of your archives. You can initiate a job requesting S3 Glacier to prepare an entire archive or a portion of the archive for subsequent download. When an archive is very large, you may find it cost effective to initiate several sequential jobs to prepare your archive. \nFor more information, see Downloading an Archive in Amazon S3 Glacier.\nFor pricing information, go to the S3 Glacier detail page. November 13, 2012 New Guide This is the first release of the Amazon S3 Glacier Developer Guide. August 20, 2012",

"text": "Change\nDescription\nRelease Date Querying archives with SQL S3 Glacier now supports querying data archives with SQL. For more information, see Querying Archives with S3 Glacier Select.\nThe following APIs are updated accordingly: Describe Job (GET JobID)\n\nInitiate Job (POST jobs)\n\nList Jobs (GET jobs) November 29, 2017 Expedited and Bulk Data Retrievals S3 Glacier now supports Expedited and Bulk data retrievals in addition to Standard retrievals. For more information, see Archive Retrieval Options. November 21, 2016 Vault Lock S3 Glacier now supports Vault Lock, which allows you to easily deploy and enforce compliance controls on individual S3 Glacier vaults with a Vault Lock policy. For more information, see Amazon S3 Glacier Vault Lock and Amazon S3 Glacier Access Control with Vault Lock Policies. July 8, 2015 Vault tagging S3 Glacier now allows you to tag your S3 Glacier vaults for easier resource and cost management. Tags are labels that you can define and associate with your vaults, and using tags adds filtering capabilities to operations such as AWS cost reports. For more information, see Tagging Amazon S3 Glacier Resources and Tagging Your Amazon S3 Glacier Vaults. June 22, 2015 Vault access policies S3 Glacier now supports managing access to your individual S3 Glacier vaults by using vault access policies. You can now define an access policy directly on a vault, making it easier to grant vault access to users and business groups internal to your organization, as well as to your external business partners. For more information, see Amazon S3 Glacier Access Control with Vault Access Policies. April 27, 2015 Data retrieval policies and audit logging S3 Glacier now supports data retrieval policies and audit logging. Data retrieval policies allow you to easily set data retrieval limits and simplify data retrieval cost management. You can define your own data retrieval limits with a few clicks in the AWS console or by using the S3 Glacier API. For more information, see Amazon S3 Glacier Data Retrieval Policies.\nIn addition, S3 Glacier now supports audit logging with AWS CloudTrail, which records S3 Glacier API calls for your account and delivers the log files to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. For more information, see Logging Amazon S3 Glacier API Calls with AWS CloudTrail. December 11, 2014 Updates to Java samples Updated the Java code samples in this guide that use the AWS SDK for Java. June 27, 2014 Limiting vault inventory retrieval You can now limit the number of vault inventory items retrieved by filtering on the archive creation date or by setting a limit. For more information about limiting inventory retrieval, see Range Inventory Retrieval in the Initiate Job (POST jobs) topic. December 31, 2013 Removed outdated URLs Removed the URLs that pointed to the old security credentials page from code examples. July 26, 2013 Support for range retrievals S3 Glacier now supports retrieval of specific ranges of your archives. You can initiate a job requesting S3 Glacier to prepare an entire archive or a portion of the archive for subsequent download. When an archive is very large, you may find it cost effective to initiate several sequential jobs to prepare your archive. \nFor more information, see Downloading an Archive in Amazon S3 Glacier.\nFor pricing information, go to the S3 Glacier detail page.

However, a vault lock policy can be locked to prevent future changes, providing strong enforcement for your compliance controls. You can use the vault lock policy to deploy regulatory and compliance controls, which typically require tight controls on data access. In contrast, you use a vault access policy to implement access controls that are not compliance related, temporary, and subject to frequent modification. Vault lock and vault access policies can be used together. For example, you can implement time-based data retention rules in the vault lock policy (deny deletes), and grant read access to designated third parties or your business partners (allow reads).",

However, if the high-level API does not offer the functionality, you can use the low-level API. Additionally, the low-level API allows granular control of the operation such as retry logic in the event of a failure. For example, when uploading an archive the high-level API uses the file size to determine whether to upload the archive in a single operation or use the multipart upload API. The API also has built-in retry logic in case an upload fails. However, your application might need granular control over these decisions, in which case you can use the low-level API.",
