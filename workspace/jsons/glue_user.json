To do this, follow the instructions in step 1 of the tutorial about delegating access to the billing console.\n\nBack in the list of groups, select the check box for your new group. Choose Refresh if necessary to see the group in the list.\n\nChoose Next: Tags.\n\n(Optional) Add metadata to the user by attaching tags as key-value pairs.

Visual with a blank canvas \u00e2\u0080\u0093 To create a job starting with an empty canvas\n\nVisual with a source and target \u00e2\u0080\u0093 To create a job starting with source node, or with a source, transform and target node\nYou then choose the data source type. You can also choose the data target type, or you can choose the Choose later option from the Target drop-down list to start with only a data source node in the graph.\n\nSpark script editor \u00e2\u0080\u0093 For those familiar with programming and writing ETL scripts, choose this option to create a new Spark ETL job. You then have the option of writing Python or Scala code in a script editor window, or uploading an existing script from a local file. If you choose to use the script editor, you can't use the visual job editor to design or edit your job. \nA Spark job is run in an Apache Spark environment managed by AWS Glue. By default, new scripts are coded in Python. To write a new Scala script, see Creating and editing Scala scripts in AWS Glue Studio.\n\nPython Shell script editor \u00e2\u0080\u0093 For those familiar with programming and writing ETL scripts, choose this option to create a new Python shell job. You write code in a script editor window starting with a template (boilerplate), or you can upload an existing script from a local file. If you choose to use the Python shell editor, you can't use the visual job editor to design or edit your job.\nA Python shell job runs Python scripts as a shell and supports a Python version that depends on the AWS Glue version you choose for the job. You can use these jobs to schedule and run tasks that don't require an Apache Spark environment. Jupyter Notebook \u00e2\u0080\u0093 For those familiar with programming and writing ETL scripts, choose this option to create a new Python or Scala job script using a notebook interface based on Jupyter notebook. You write code in a notebook. If you choose to use the notebook interface to create your job, you can't use the visual job editor to design or edit your job.\nYou can also use a command line interface to easily configure a notebook for authoring jobs. Choose Create to create a job in the editing interface that you selected. If you chose the Jupyter notebook option, the Create job in Jupyter notebook page appears instead of the job editor interface. You must provide additional information before creating a notebook authoring session.

This role must have the necessary permissions to access the data and other resources needed to create the data previews.\n\nAfter you provide an IAM role, it takes a while before the data is available for viewing. For datasets with less than 1 GB of data, it can take up to one minute. If you have a large dataset, you should use partitions to improve the loading time. Loading data directly from Amazon S3 has the best performance.\n\nIf you have a very large dataset, and it takes more than 30 minutes to query the data for the data preview, the request will time out. You can reduce the dataset size to use data previews.\n\nBy default, you see the first 5 columns in the Data preview tab. If the columns have no data values, you will get a message that there is no data to display. You can increase the number of rows sampled, or selected different columns to see data values.\n\nData previews are currently not supported for streaming data sources, or for data sources that use custom connectors.\n\nErrors on one node effect the entire job. If any one node has an error with data previews, the error will show up on all nodes until you correct it.\n\nIf you change a data source for the job, then the child nodes of that data source might need to be updated to match the new schema. For example, if you have an ApplyMapping node that modifies a column, and the column does not exist in the replacement data source, you will need to update the ApplyMapping transform node.\n\nIf you view the Data preview tab for a SQL query transform node, and the SQL query uses an incorrect field name, the Data preview tab shows an error.",

You can choose Browse S3 to select the path from the locations available to your account. Recursive: Choose this option if you want AWS Glue Studio to read data from files in child folders at the S3 location. \nIf the child folders contain partitioned data, AWS Glue Studio doesn't add any partition information that's specified in the folder names to the Data Catalog. For example, consider the following folders in Amazon S3:\nS3://sales/year=2019/month=Jan/day=1\nS3://sales/year=2019/month=Jan/day=2\nIf you choose Recursive and select the sales folder as your S3 location, then AWS Glue Studio reads the data in all the child folders, but doesn't create partitions for year, month or day.\n\nData format: Choose the format that the data is stored in. You can choose JSON, CSV, or Parquet. The value you select tells the AWS Glue job how to read the data from the source file.\nNoteIf you don't select the correct format for your data, AWS Glue Studio might infer the schema correctly, but the job won't be able to correctly parse the data from the source file.\nYou can enter additional configuration options, depending on the format you choose. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) JsonPath: Enter a JSON path that points to an object that is used to define a table schema. JSON path expressions always refer to a JSON structure in the same way as XPath expression are used in combination with an XML document. The \"root member object\" in the JSON path is always referred to as $, even if it's an object or array. The JSON path can be written in dot notation or bracket notation.\nFor more information about the JSON path, see JsonPath on the GitHub website.\n\nRecords in source files can span multiple lines: Choose this option if a single record can span multiple lines in the CSV file. CSV (comma-separated values) Delimiter: Enter a character to denote what separates each column entry in the row, for example, ; or ,.\n\nEscape character: Enter a character that is used as an escape character. This character indicates that the character that immediately follows the escape character should be taken literally, and should not be interpreted as a delimiter.\n\nQuote character: Enter the character that is used to group separate strings into a single value. For example, you would choose Double quote (\") if you have values such as \"This is a single value\" in your CSV file.\n\nRecords in source files can span multiple lines: Choose this option if a single record can span multiple lines in the CSV file.\n\nFirst line of source file contains column headers: Choose this option if the first row in the CSV file contains column headers instead of data. Parquet (Apache Parquet columnar storage)\nThere are no additional settings to configure for data stored in Parquet format. Partition predicate: To partition the data that is read from the data source, enter a Boolean expression based on Spark SQL that includes only the partitioning columns. For example: \"(year=='2020' and month=='04')\"\n\nAdvanced options: Expand this section if you want AWS Glue Studio to detect the schema of your data based on a specific file. Schema inference: Choose the option Choose a sample file from S3 if you want to use a specific file instead of letting AWS Glue Studio choose a file.\n\nAuto-sampled file: Enter the path to the file in Amazon S3 to use for inferring the schema.\n\nIf you're editing a data source node and change the selected sample file, choose Reload schema to detect the schema by using the new sample file. Choose the Infer schema button to detect the schema from the sources files in Amazon S3. If you change the Amazon S3 location or the sample file, you must choose Infer schema again to infer the schema using the new information.",

You can rename keys, modify the data types for keys, and choose which keys to drop from the dataset.\n\nSelectFields: Choose the data property keys that you want to keep.\n\nDropFields: Choose the data property keys that you want to drop.\n\nRenameField: Rename a single data property key.\n\nSpigot: Write samples of the data to an Amazon S3 bucket.\n\nJoin: Join two datasets into one dataset using a comparison phrase on the specified data property keys. You can use inner, outer, left, right, left semi, and left anti joins.\n\nSplitFields: Split data property keys into two DynamicFrames. Output is a collection of DynamicFrames: one with selected data property keys, and one with the remaining data property keys. SelectFromCollection: Choose one DynamicFrame from a collection of DynamicFrames. The output is the selected DynamicFrame.\n\nFillMissingValues: Locate records in the dataset that have missing values and add a new field with a suggested value that is determined by imputation\n\nFilter: Split a dataset into two, based on a filter condition. DropNullFields: Removes columns from the dataset if all values in the column are \u00e2\u0080\u0098null\u00e2\u0080\u0099. SQL: Enter SparkSQL code into a text entry field to use a SQL query to transform the data. The output is a single DynamicFrame. Aggregate: performs a calculation (such as average, sum, min, max) on selected fields and rows, and creates a new field with the newly calculated value(s). Custom transform: Enter code into a text entry field to use custom transforms. The output is a collection of DynamicFrames.",

See Adding nodes to the job diagram for details.\n\nChoose one of the source nodes for the join. Choose Transform in the toolbar at the top of the visual editor, and then choose Join to add a new transform to your job diagram.\n\nOn the Node properties tab, enter a name for the node in the job diagram.\n\nIn the Node properties tab, under the heading Node parents, add a parent node so that there are two datasets providing inputs for the join. The parent can be a data source node or a transform node. \nNoteA join can have only two parent nodes.\n\nChoose the Transform tab.\nIf you see a message indicating that there are conflicting key names, you can either: Choose Resolve it to automatically add an ApplyMapping transform node to your job diagram. The ApplyMapping node adds a prefix to any keys in the dataset that have the same name as a key in the other dataset. For example, if you use the default value of right, then any keys in the right dataset that have the same name as a key in the left dataset will be renamed to (right)key name.\n\nManually add a transform node earlier in the job diagram to remove or rename the conflicting keys. Choose the type of join in the Join type list. Inner join: Returns a row with columns from both datasets for every match based on the join condition. Rows that don't satisfy the join condition aren't returned.\n\nLeft join: All rows from the left dataset and only the rows from the right dataset that satisfy the join condition. Right join: All rows from the right dataset and only the rows from the left dataset that satisfy the join condition.\n\nOuter join: All rows from both datasets.\n\nLeft semi join: All rows from the left dataset that have a match in the right dataset based on the join condition. Left anti join: All rows in the left dataset that don't have a match in the right dataset based on join condition. On the Transform tab, under the heading Join conditions, choose Add condition. Choose a property key from each dataset to compare. Property keys on the left side of the comparison operator are referred to as the left dataset and property keys on the right are referred to as the right dataset. For more complex join conditions, you can add additional matching keys by choosing Add condition more than once. If you accidentally add a condition, you can choose the delete icon (\n\n) to remove it.\n(Optional) After configuring the transform node properties, you can view the modified schema for your data by choosing the Output schema tab in the node details panel.

"text": "To edit the job script or upload your own script\nIf creating a new job, on the Jobs page, choose the Spark script editor option to create a Spark job or choose the Python Shell script editor to create a Python shell job. You can either write a new script, or upload an existing script. If you choose Spark script editor, you can write or upload either a Scala or Python script. If you choose Python Shell script editor, you can only write or upload a Python script.\nAfter choosing the option to create a new job, in the Options section that appears, you can choose to either start with a starter script (Create a new script with boilerplate code), or you can upload a local file to use as the job script.\nIf you chose Spark script editor, you can upload either Python or Scala script files. Scala scripts must have the file extension .scala. Python scripts must be recognized as files of type Python. If you chose Python Shell script editor, you can upload only Python script files.\nWhen you are finished making your choices, choose Create to create the job and open the visual editor.\n\nGo to the visual job editor for the new or saved job, and then choose the Script tab.\n\nIf you didn't create a new job using one of the script editor options, and you have never edited the script for an existing job, the Script tab displays the heading Script (Locked). This means the script editor is in read-only mode. Choose Edit script to unlock the script for editing.\nTo make the script editable, AWS Glue Studio converts your job from a visual job to a script-only job. If you unlock the script for editing, you can't use the visual editor anymore for this job after you save it.\nIn the confirmation window, choose Confirm to continue or Cancel to keep the job available for visual editing.\nIf you choose Confirm, the Visual tab no longer appears in the editor. You can use AWS Glue Studio to modify the script using the script editor, modify the job details or schedule, or view job runs.\nNoteUntil you save the job, the conversion to a script-only job is not permanent. If you refresh the console web page, or close the job before saving it and reopen it in the visual editor, you will still be able to edit the individual nodes in the visual editor.\n\nEdit the script as needed. \nWhen you are done editing the script, choose Save to save the job and permanently convert the job from visual to script-only.\n\n(Optional) You can download the script from the AWS Glue Studio console by choosing the Download button on the Script tab. When you choose this button, a new browser window opens, displaying the script from its location in Amazon S3. The Script filename and Script path parameters in the Job details tab of the job determine the name and location of the script file in Amazon S3. When you save the job, AWS Glue save the job script at the location specified by these fields. If you modify the script file at this location within Amazon S3, AWS Glue Studio will load the modified script the next time you edit the job.",

Adding these context words can help match the entity. Click Create to create the detection entity. Any created entities are visible in the AWS Glue Studio console.

Choose Jupyter notebook and then choose Create to start a new notebook session. On the Create job in Jupyter notebook page, provide the job name, and choose the IAM role to use. Choose Create job. After a short time period, the notebook editor appears. After you add the code you must execute the cell to initiate a session. There are multiple ways to execute the cell: Press the play button.Use a keyboard shortcut such as command + enter (MacOS). For information about writing code using a Jupyter notebook interface, see The Jupyter Notebook User Documentation . To test your script, run the entire script, or individual cells. Any command output will be displayed in the area beneath the cell. After you have finished developing your notebook, you can save the job and then run it. You can find the script in the Script tab. Any magics you added to the notebook will be stripped away and won't be saved as part of the script of the generated AWS Glue job.

"text": "To add a custom connector to AWS Glue Studio\nCreate the code for your custom connector. For more information, see Developing custom connectors.\n\nAdd support for AWS Glue features to your connector. Here are some examples of these features and how they are used within the job script generated by AWS Glue Studio: Data type mapping \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Your connector can typecast the columns while reading them from the underlying data store. For example, a dataTypeMapping of {\"INTEGER\":\"STRING\"} converts all columns of type Integer to columns of type String when parsing the records and constructing the DynamicFrame. This helps users to cast columns to types of their choice.\nDataSource0 = glueContext.create_dynamic_frame.from_options(connection_type \n= \"custom.jdbc\", connection_options = {\"dataTypeMapping\":{\"INTEGER\":\"STRING\"}\", \nconnectionName\":\"test-connection-jdbc\"}, transformation_ctx = \"DataSource0\")\n\nPartitioning for parallel reads \u00e2\u0080\u0093 AWS Glue allows parallel data reads from the data store by partitioning the data on a column. You must specify the partition column, the lower partition bound, the upper partition bound, and the number of partitions. This feature enables you to make use of data parallelism and multiple Spark executors allocated for the Spark application.\nDataSource0 = glueContext.create_dynamic_frame.from_options(connection_type \n= \"custom.jdbc\", connection_options = {\"upperBound\":\"200\",\"numPartitions\":\"4\",\n\"partitionColumn\":\"id\",\"lowerBound\":\"0\",\"connectionName\":\"test-connection-jdbc\"},\ntransformation_ctx = \"DataSource0\")\n\nUse AWS Secrets Manager for storing credentials \u00e2\u0080\u0093The Data Catalog connection can also contain a secretId for a secret stored in AWS Secrets Manager. The AWS secret can securely store authentication and credentials information and provide it to your ETL job at runtime. Alternatively, you can specify the secretId from the Spark script as follows:\nDataSource = glueContext.create_dynamic_frame.from_options(connection_type \n= \"custom.jdbc\", connection_options = {\"connectionName\":\"test-connection-jdbc\",\n \"secretId\"-> \"my-secret-id\"}, transformation_ctx = \"DataSource0\")\n\nFiltering the source data with row predicates and column projections \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The AWS Glue Spark runtime also allows users to push down SQL queries to filter data at the source with row predicates and column projections. This allows your ETL job to load filtered data faster from data stores that support push-downs. An example SQL query pushed down to a JDBC data source is: SELECT id, name, department FROM department WHERE id < 200.\nDataSource = glueContext.create_dynamic_frame.from_options(connection_type = \n\"custom.jdbc\", connection_options = {\"query\":\"SELECT id, name, department FROM department \nWHERE id < 200\",\"connectionName\":\"test-connection-jdbc\"}, transformation_ctx = \n\"DataSource0\")\n\nJob bookmarks \u00e2\u0080\u0093 AWS Glue supports incremental loading of data from JDBC sources. AWS Glue keeps track of the last processed record from the data store, and processes new data records in the subsequent ETL job runs. Job bookmarks use the primary key as the default column for the bookmark key, provided that this column increases or decreases sequentially. For more information about job bookmarks, see Job Bookmarks in the AWS Glue Developer Guide.\nDataSource0 = glueContext.create_dynamic_frame.from_options(connection_type = \n\"custom.jdbc\", connection_options = {\"jobBookmarkKeys\":[\"empno\"], \"jobBookmarkKeysSortOrder\"\n:\"asc\", \"connectionName\":\"test-connection-jdbc\"}, transformation_ctx = \"DataSource0\") Package the custom connector as a JAR file and upload the file to Amazon S3.\n\nTest your custom connector. For more information, see the instructions on GitHub at Glue Custom Connectors: Local Validation Tests Guide.\n\nIn the AWS Glue Studio console, choose Connectors in the console navigation pane.\n\nOn the Connectors page, choose Create custom connector.\n\nOn the Create custom connector page, enter the following information: The path to the location of the custom code JAR file in Amazon S3.\n\nA name for the connector that will be used by AWS Glue Studio.\n\nYour connector type, which can be one of JDBC, Spark, or Athena.\n\nThe name of the entry point within your custom code that AWS Glue Studio calls to use the connector. For JDBC connectors, this field should be the class name of your JDBC driver.\n\nFor Spark connectors, this field should be the fully qualified data source class name, or its alias, that you use when loading the Spark data source with the format operator. (JDBC only) The base URL used by the JDBC connection for the data store.\n\n(Optional) A description of the custom connector. Choose Create connector. From the Connectors page, create a connection that uses this connector, as described in Creating connections for connectors.",

"text": "To configure the properties for a data source node that uses a connector\nChoose the connector data source node in the job graph or add a new node and choose the connector for the Node type. Then, on the right-side, in the node details panel, choose the Data source properties tab, if it's not already selected. In the Data source properties tab, choose the connection that you want to use for this job. Enter the additional information required for each connection type:\n\nJDBC Data source input type: Choose to provide either a table name or a SQL query as the data source. Depending on your choice, you then need to provide the following additional information: Table name: The name of the table in the data source. If the data source does not use the term table, then supply the name of an appropriate data structure, as indicated by the custom connector usage information (which is available in AWS Marketplace).\n\nFilter predicate: A condition clause to use when reading the data source, similar to a WHERE clause, which is used to retrieve a subset of the data.\n\nQuery code: Enter a SQL query to use to retrieve a specific dataset from the data source. An example of a basic SQL query is:\nSELECT column_list FROM table_name WHERE where_clause Schema: Because AWS Glue Studio is using information stored in the connection to access the data source instead of retrieving metadata information from a Data Catalog table, you must provide the schema metadata for the data source. Choose Add schema to open the schema editor. \nFor instructions on how to use the schema editor, see Editing the schema in a custom transform node.\n\nPartition column: (Optional) You can choose to partition the data reads by providing values for Partition column, Lower bound, Upper bound, and Number of partitions. \nThe lowerBound and upperBound values are used to decide the partition stride, not for filtering the rows in table. All rows in the table are partitioned and returned. \nNoteColumn partitioning adds an extra partitioning condition to the query used to read the data. When using a query instead of a table name, you should validate that the query works with the specified partitioning condition. For example:\n\nIf your query format is \"SELECT col1 FROM table1\", then test the query by appending a WHERE clause at the end of the query that uses the partition column.\n\nIf your query format is \"SELECT col1 FROM table1 WHERE col2=val\", then test the query by extending the WHERE clause with AND and an expression that uses the partition column. Data type casting: If the data source uses data types that are not available in JDBC, use this section to specify how a data type from the data source should be converted into JDBC data types. You can specify up to 50 different data type conversions. All columns in the data source that use the same data type are converted in the same way. \nFor example, if you have three columns in the data source that use the Float data type, and you indicate that the Float data type should be converted to the JDBC String data type, then all three columns that use the Float data type are converted to String data types.\n\nJob bookmark keys: Job bookmarks help AWS Glue maintain state information and prevent the reprocessing of old data. Specify one more one or more columns as bookmark keys. AWS Glue Studio uses bookmark keys to track data that has already been processed during a previous run of the ETL job. Any columns you use for custom bookmark keys must be strictly monotonically increasing or decreasing, but gaps are permitted.\nIf you enter multiple bookmark keys, they're combined to form a single compound key. A compound job bookmark key should not contain duplicate columns. If you don't specify bookmark keys, AWS Glue Studio by default uses the primary key as the bookmark key, provided that the primary key is sequentially increasing or decreasing (with no gaps). If the table doesn't have a primary key, but the job bookmark property is enabled, you must provide custom job bookmark keys. Otherwise, the search for primary keys to use as the default will fail and the job run will fail.\nJob bookmark keys sorting order: Choose whether the key values are sequentially increasing or decreasing.\n\nSpark Schema: Because AWS Glue Studio is using information stored in the connection to access the data source instead of retrieving metadata information from a Data Catalog table, you must provide the schema metadata for the data source. Choose Add schema to open the schema editor. \nFor instructions on how to use the schema editor, see Editing the schema in a custom transform node.\n\nConnection options: Enter additional key-value pairs as needed to provide additional connection information or options. For example, you might enter a database name, table name, a user name, and password.\nFor example, for OpenSearch, you enter the following key-value pairs, as described in Tutorial: Using the open-source Elasticsearch Spark Connector: es.net.http.auth.user : username\n\nes.net.http.auth.pass : password es.nodes : https://<Elasticsearch endpoint>\n\nes.port : 443\n\npath: <Elasticsearch resource>\n\nes.nodes.wan.only : true For an example of the minimum connection options to use, see the sample test script MinimalSparkConnectorTest.scala on GitHub, which shows the connection options you would normally provide in a connection.\n\nAthena Table name: The name of the table in the data source. If you're using a connector for reading from Athena-CloudWatch logs, you would enter the table name all_log_streams.\n\nAthena schema name: Choose the schema in your Athena data source that corresponds to the database that contains the table. If you're using a connector for reading from Athena-CloudWatch logs, you would enter a schema name similar to /aws/glue/name.\n\nSchema: Because AWS Glue Studio is using information stored in the connection to access the data source instead of retrieving metadata information from a Data Catalog table, you must provide the schema metadata for the data source. Choose Add schema to open the schema editor. \nFor instructions on how to use the schema editor, see Editing the schema in a custom transform node.\n\nAdditional connection options: Enter additional key-value pairs as needed to provide additional connection information or options. For an example, see the README.md file at https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-glue-samples/tree/master/GlueCustomConnectors/development/Athena. In the steps in this document, the sample code shows the minimal required connection options, which are tableName, schemaName, and className. The code example specifies these options as part of the optionsMap variable, but you can specify them for your connection and then use the connection. (Optional) After providing the required information, you can view the resulting data schema for your data source by choosing the Output schema tab in the node details panel. The schema displayed on this tab is used by any child nodes that you add to the job graph.\n\n(Optional) After configuring the node properties and data source properties, you can preview the dataset from your data source by choosing the Data preview tab in the node details panel. The first time you choose this tab for any node in your job, you are prompted to provide an IAM role to access the data. There is a cost associated with using this feature, and billing starts as soon as you provide an IAM role.",

On the right, on the Data source properties - Connector tab, configure additional information for the connector. Choose Add schema and enter the schema of the data set in the data source. Connections do not use tables stored in the Data Catalog, which means that AWS Glue Studio doesn't know the schema of the data. You must manually provide this schema information. For instructions on how to use the schema editor, see Editing the schema in a custom transform node.\n\nExpand Connection options.\n\nChoose Add new option and enter the information needed for the connector that was not entered in the AWS secret: es.nodes : https://<ElasticSearch endpoint>\n\nes.port : 443\n\npath : test\n\nes.nodes.wan.only. : true For an explanation of these connection options, refer to: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/hadoop/current/configuration.html. Add a target node to the graph as described in Adding nodes to the job diagram and Editing the data target node. \nYour data target can be Amazon S3, or it can use information from an AWS Glue Data Catalog or a connector to write data in a different location. For example, you can use a Data Catalog table to write to a database in Amazon RDS, or you can use a connector as your data target to write to data stores that are not natively supported in AWS Glue. If you choose a connector for your data target, you must choose a connection created for that connector. Also, if required by the connector provider, you must add options to provide additional information to the connector. If you use a connection that contains information for an AWS secret, then you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to provide the user name and password authentication in the connection options. Optionally, add additional data sources and one or more transform nodes as described in Editing the data transform node.\n\nConfigure the job properties as described in Modify the job properties, starting with step 3, and save the job.",

Then choose Create Schedule. On the Schedule job run page, enter the following information: Name: Enter a name for your job schedule. Frequency: Enter the frequency for the job schedule. You can choose the following: Hourly: The job will run every hour, starting at a specific minute. You can specify the Minute of the hour that the job should run. By default, when you choose hourly, the job runs at the beginning of the hour (minute 0).\n\nDaily: The job will run every day, starting at a time. You can specify the Minute of the hour that the job should run and the Start hour for the job. Hours are specified using a 23-hour clock, where you use the numbers 13 to 23 for the afternoon hours. The default values for minute and hour are 0, which means that if you select Daily, the job by default will run at midnight.\n\nWeekly: The job will run every week on one or more days. In addition to the same settings described previous for Daily, you can choose the days of the week on which the job will run. You can choose one or more days.\n\nMonthly: The job will run every month on a specific day. In addition to the same settings described previous for Daily, you can choose the day of the month on which the job will run. Specify the day as a numeric value from 1 to 31. If you select a day that does not exist in a month, for example the 30th day of February, then the job does not run that month.\n\nCustom: Enter an expression for your job schedule using the cron syntax. Cron expressions allow you to create more complicated schedules, such as the last day of the month (instead of a specific day of the month) or every third month on the 7th and 21st days of the month. \nSee Cron Expressions in the AWS Glue Developer Guide Description: You can optionally enter a description for your job schedule. If you plan to use the same schedule for multiple jobs, having a description makes it easier to determine what the job schedule does. Choose Create schedule to save the job schedule.\n\nAfter you create the schedule, a success message appears at the top of the console page. You can choose Job details in this banner to view the job details. This opens the visual job editor page, with the Schedules tab selected.",

Delay notification threshold (minutes) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Specify a delay threshold for the job.

"text": "To create a crawler that reads files stored on Amazon S3\nOn the AWS Glue service console, on the left-side menu, choose Crawlers.\n\nOn the Crawlers page, choose Add crawler. This starts a series of pages that prompt you for the crawler details.\n\nIn the Crawler name field, enter Flights Data Crawler, and choose Next.\nCrawlers invoke classifiers to infer the schema of your data. This tutorial uses the built-in classifier for CSV by default. For the crawler source type, choose Data stores and choose Next.\n\nNow let's point the crawler to your data. On the Add a data store page, choose the Amazon S3 data store. This tutorial doesn't use a connection, so leave the Connection field blank if it's visible. \nFor the option Crawl data in, choose Specified path in another account. Then, for the Include path, enter the path where the crawler can find the flights data, which is s3://crawler-public-us-east-1/flight/2016/csv. After you enter the path, the title of this field changes to Include path. Choose Next.\n\nYou can crawl multiple data stores with a single crawler. However, in this tutorial, we're using only a single data store, so choose No, and then choose Next.\n\nThe crawler needs permissions to access the data store and create objects in the AWS Glue Data Catalog. To configure these permissions, choose Create an IAM role. The IAM role name starts with AWSGlueServiceRole-, and in the field, you enter the last part of the role name. Enter CrawlerTutorial, and then choose Next. \nNoteTo create an IAM role, your AWS user must have CreateRole, CreatePolicy, and AttachRolePolicy permissions.\nThe wizard creates an IAM role named AWSGlueServiceRole-CrawlerTutorial, attaches the AWS managed policy AWSGlueServiceRole to this role, and adds an inline policy that allows read access to the Amazon S3 location s3://crawler-public-us-east-1/flight/2016/csv.\n\nCreate a schedule for the crawler. For Frequency, choose Run on demand, and then choose Next. Crawlers create tables in your Data Catalog. Tables are contained in a database in the Data Catalog. First, choose Add database to create a database. In the pop-up window, enter test-flights-db for the database name, and then choose Create.\nNext, enter flights for Prefix added to tables. Use the default values for the rest of the options, and choose Next.\n\nVerify the choices you made in the Add crawler wizard. If you see any mistakes, you can choose Back to return to previous pages and make changes.\nAfter you have reviewed the information, choose Finish to create the crawler.",

AWS Glue provides a shuffle manager which writes and reads shuffle files to and from Amazon S3. Writing and reading shuffle files from Amazon S3 is slower (by 5%-20%) compared to local disk (or Amazon EBS which is heavily optimized for Amazon EC2).
