Gateway Queue Manager A gateway Queue Manager is used to balance the workload. by routing traffic across multiple IBM MQ Queue Managers. Network of Brokers Amazon MQ provides Network of Brokers to route traffic to multiple brokers. Local Queues A local queue is a definition of both a queue and the set of messages that are associated with a queue. The hosting IBM MQ Queue Manager receives messages in its local queues. Local queues support several IBM MQ specific properties like put, get, inhibits, etc. Queues This is equivalent to queues in Amazon MQ. Remote Queues Remote queues are used to refer to a queue which physically exists on a different IBM MQ Queue Manager, but connectivity is established using channels (Sender Channel and Receiver Channel) Network of Brokers This is achieved using a Network of Brokers. Networks of Brokers connect to one another on a Network Connector. With a Netowork of Brokers, you can create connections across different Regions and Availability Zones. Alias Queues Alias queues are used to give a different name to a different physical queue. It allows setting different security settings to the same physical queue. Composite and Virtual Destinations Composite Destinations and Virtual destinations provide the same functionality in the Amazon MQ world. You can achieve this by making a minor change in a broker configuration file. Model Queues Acts as a template for a queue definition. Destination Policy This can be achieved using Destination Policies in the broker configuration file Transmission Queues Used for remote queue connectivity Network of Brokers A network of Brokers provides equivalent configuration using Network Connector Topics Pub-Sub destination Topics Topics in Amazon MQ Server connection channel Basic construct through which direct connectivity from a remote application client to an MQ server is established. Admins can create multiple connection channels to enforce different policies. A default server connection channel is created for each IBM MQ Queue Manager. Allows for monitoring of connections from remote clients. Transport Connector Provides the details for the connection point for producers and consumers to connect to a broker. Client Connection Channel Client connection channel in IBM MQ allows a connection mode where a config file (client connection definition table, or CCDT) is kept on the client application side which specifies options around connecting to an IBM MQ Queue Manager. Usually, legacy applications prior to JMS were written using this mechanism. Transport Connector Transport Connector provides the details for the connection point for producers and consumers to connect to a broker. Channel level Firewall Channel level Firewall is used to blacklist/whitelist IP address, protocols Security Group With Amazon MQ, use the Security Group at the broker level and use NACL at the subnet level to create a firewall. Error Logs Each IBM MQ Queue Manager has a configuration around transaction logs. It's similar to database logs. It has a size and policy (circular/linear). Any time there is a shared JMS transaction, the state is written in a log file for rollback or commit. Amazon CloudWatch CloudWatch logs are fully integrated with Amazon MQ. For more information, see Monitoring Amazon MQ Brokers Using Amazon CloudWatch. Listener A listener is an IBM MQ process that listens for connections to the IBM MQ Queue Manager. Broker Instance Amazon MQ is a managed broker and acts as a listener by itself. LDAP Authentication IBM MQ provides out of box connectivity to LDAP and group-based access to QM, queues, topics, etc. It also supports fine-grained access control at queue and topic levels. IAM and LDAP Authentication Simple authentication is available with Amazon MQ. Fine-grained access is only available at the broker user level. Fine-Grained Access Control at queue and topic level with access options to Get, Put. To learn more, see Messaging Authentication and Authorization. Message channel agent (MCA) MCA is used to enforce an alternate level of security. The default configuration is at the server connection channel level. Not Applicable Not Applicable Channel exit programs Channel exit programs are programs that are called at defined places in the processing sequence of a Message channel agent (MCA). Users and vendors can write their own channel exit programs. Some are supplied by IBM. Plugins Limited plugins supported.

For more information about using AWS CloudFormation to set up Amazon MQ brokers, see the Amazon MQ AWS CloudFormation Template Reference. Log in to IBM MQ Queue Manager Host and list the queues/topics definitions. In QM_ORANGE, you can list the queues and topics from IBM MQ using the following command: $ sudo dmpmqcfg -m QM_ORANGE -t queue -o 1line | grep -v \"SYSTEM\" | grep -v \"AUTHREC\" | grep -v \"*\" | gawk -F: '{ print $1 }\u00e2\u0080\u0098 The output: DEFINE QREMOTE('Q1') RQMNAME('QM_APPLE') RNAME('Q1') XMITQ('QM_APPLE') REPLACE \nDEFINE QLOCAL('Q2') DISTL(NO) MAXDEPTH(5000) REPLACE \nDEFINE QLOCAL('QM_APPLE') GET(DISABLED) MAXDEPTH(5000) USAGE(XMITQ) REPLACE In the example above, Q1 is the link to the remote queue, QM_APPLE is the transit queue, and Q2 is the local queue. We only need local queue Q2 for the Amazon MQ setup, which can be defined in the broker configuration as <queue physicalName=\"Q2\"/> Q1 is a local queue on QM_APPLE and Q2 is a local queue in QM_ORANGE. You can these resources accordingly in AMQ_APPLE and AMQ_ORANGE by using the following configuration <destinations> <queue physicalName=\"localQ1\"/>\n</destinations>\n\nSimilairly, get the list of queues and topics from QM_APPLE. Manually create a dead letter queue strategy in the AMQ configuration file. The defaultdead letter queue in ActiveMQ is called ActiveMQ.DLQ. All un-deliverable messages will get routed to this queue. To streamline this process, you can set up an individualDeadLetterStrategy in the destination policy map of the activemq.xml configuration file, allowing you to specify a specific dead letter queue prefix for a given queue or topic. You can apply this strategy using a wild-card so that all queues can be set up with their own dead-letter queues, as is shown in the example below: <broker> <destinationPolicy> <policyMap> <policyEntries> <!-- Set the following policy on all queues using the '>' wildcard --> <policyEntry queue=\">\"> <deadLetterStrategy> <!-- Use the prefix 'DLQ.' for the destination name, and make the DLQ a queue rather than a topic --> <individualDeadLetterStrategy queuePrefix=\"DLQ.\" useQueueForQueueMessages=\"true\"/> </deadLetterStrategy> </policyEntry> </policyEntries> </policyMap> </destinationPolicy> \n</broker>\n\nNote\nDead-Letter queue expiration - By default, ActiveMQ will never expire messages sent to a Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ). However, beginning with ActiveMQ 5.12, the deadLetterStrategy supports an expiration attribute whose value is given in milliseconds as shown below: <broker> <destinationPolicy> <policyMap> <policyEntries> <policyEntry queue=\"QueueWhereItIsOkToExpireDLQEntries\"> <deadLetterStrategy> <.... expiration=\"300000\"/> </deadLetterStrategy> </policyEntry> </policyEntries> </policyMap> </destinationPolicy>\n</broker> Create local queue Q1 on AMQ_ORANGE and Q2 on AMQ_APPLE as shown in the following:",
