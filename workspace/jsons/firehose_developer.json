"text": "Enter values for the following fields: S3 bucket Choose an S3 bucket that you own where the streaming data should be delivered. You can create a new S3 bucket or choose an existing one. S3 bucket prefix - optional If you don't enable dynamic partitioning, this is an optional field. If you choose to enable dynamic partitioning, you MUST specify an S3 error bucket prefix for Kinesis Data Firehose to use when delivering data to Amazon S3 in error conditions. If Kinesis Data Firehose fails to dynamically partition your incoming data, those data records are delivered to this S3 error bucket prefix. For more information, see Amazon S3 Object Name Format and Custom Prefixes for Amazon S3 Objects Dynamic partitioning Choose Enabled to enable and configure dynamic partitioning. Multi record deagreggation This is the process of parsing through the records in the delivery stream and separating them based either on valid JSON or on the specified new line delimiter.\nIf you aggregate multiple events, logs, or records into a single PutRecord and PutRecordBatch API call, you can still enable and configure dynamic partitioning. With aggregated data, when you enable dynamic partitioning, Kinesis Data Firehose parses the records and looks for multiple valid JSON objects within each API call. When the delivery stream is configured with Kinesis Data Stream as a source, you can also use the built-in aggregation in the Kinesis Producer Library (KPL). Data partition functionality is executed after data is de-aggregated. Therefore, each record in each API call can be delivered to different Amazon S3 prefixes. You can also leverage the Lambda function integration to perform any other de-aggregation or any other transformation before the data partitioning functionality.\nImportantIf your data is aggregated, dynamic partitioning can be applied only after data deaggregation is performed. So if you enable dynamic partitioning to your aggregated data, you must choose Enabled to enable multi record deaggregation. \nKinesis Data Firehose delivery stream preforms the following processing steps in the following order: KPL (protobuf) de-aggregation, JSON or delimiter de-aggregation, Lambda processing, data partitioning, data format conversion, and Amazon S3 delivery. Multi record deaggreation type If you enabled multi recrord deaggregation, you must specify the method for Kinesis Data Firehose to deaggregate your data. Use the drop-down menu to choose either JSON or Delimited. New line delimiter When you enable dynamic partitioning, you can configure your delivery stream to add a new line delimiter between records in objects that are delivered to Amazon S3. To do so, choose Enabled. To not add a new line delimiter between records in objects that are delivered to Amazon S3, choose Disabled. Inline parsing This is one of the supported mechanisms to dynamically partition your data that is bound for Amazon S3. To use inline parsing for dynamic partitioning of your data, you must specify data record parameters to be used as partitioning keys and provide a value for each specified partitioning key. Choose Enabled to enable and configure inline parsing.\nImportantIf you specified an AWS Lambda function in the steps above for transforming your source records, you can use this function to dyncamically partition your data that is bound to S3 and you can still create your partitioning keys with inline parsing. With dynamic partitioning, you can use either inline parsing or your AWS Lambda function to create your partitioning keys. Or you can use both inline parsing and your AWS Lambda function at the same time to create your partitioning keys. Dynamic partitioning keys You can use the Key and Value fields to specify the data record parameters to be used as dynamic partitioning keys and jq queries to generate dynamic partitioning key values. Kinesis Data Firehose supports jq 1.6 only. You can specify up to 50 dynamic partitioning keys. You must enter valid jq expressions for your dynamic partitioning key values in order to successfully configure dynamic partitioning for your delivery stream. S3 bucket prefix When you enable and configure dynamic partitioning, you must specify the S3 bucket prefixes to which Kinesis Data Firehose is to deliver partitioned data.\nIn order for dynamic partitioning to be configured correctly, the number of the S3 bucket prefixes must be identical to the number of the specified partitioning keys.\n You can partition your source data with inline parsing or with your specified AWS Lambda function. If you specified an AWS Lambda function to create partitioning keys for your source data, you must manually type in the S3 bucket prefix value(s) using the following format: \"partitionKeyFromLambda:keyID\". If you are using inline parsing to specify the partitioning keys for your source data, you can either manually type in the S3 bucket preview values using the following format: \"partitionKeyFromQuery:keyID\" or you can choose the Apply dynamic partitioning keys button to use your dynamic partitioning key/value pairs to auto-generate your S3 bucket prefixes. While partitioning your data with either inline parsing or AWS Lambda, you can also use the following expression forms in your S3 bucket prefix: !{namespace:value}, where namespace can be either partitionKeyFromQuery or partitionKeyFromLambda. S3 buffer hints Kinesis Data Firehose buffers incoming data before delivering it to the specified destination. The recommended buffer size for the destination varies from service provider to service provider. S3 compressions and encryption Choose GZIP, Snappy, Zip, or Hadoop-Compatible Snappy data compression, or no data compression. Snappy, Zip, and Hadoop-Compatible Snappy compression is not available for delivery streams with Amazon Redshift as the destination. \nKinesis Data Firehose supports Amazon S3 server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) for encrypting delivered data in Amazon S3. You can choose to not encrypt the data or to encrypt with a key from the list of AWS KMS keys that you own.

Splunk endpoint type Choose Raw endpoint in most cases. Choose Event endpoint if you preprocessed your data using AWS Lambda to send data to different indexes by event type. For information about what endpoint to use, see Configure Amazon Kinesis Firehose to send data to the Splunk platform in the Splunk documentation. Authentication token To set up a Splunk endpoint that can receive data from Kinesis Data Firehose, see Installation and configuration overview for the Splunk Add-on for Amazon Kinesis Firehose in the Splunk documentation. Save the token that you get from Splunk when you set up the endpoint for this delivery stream, and add it here. HEC acknowledgement timeout Specify how long Kinesis Data Firehose waits for the index acknowledgement from Splunk. If Splunk doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t send the acknowledgment before the timeout is reached, Kinesis Data Firehose considers it a data delivery failure. Kinesis Data Firehose then either retries or backs up the data to your Amazon S3 bucket, depending on the retry duration value that you set. Retry duration Specify how long Kinesis Data Firehose retries sending data to Splunk. \nAfter sending data, Kinesis Data Firehose first waits for an acknowledgment from Splunk. If an error occurs or the acknowledgment doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t arrive within the acknowledgment timeout period, Kinesis Data Firehose starts the retry duration counter.

If the acknowledgment times out, Kinesis Data Firehose determines whether there's time left in the retry counter. If there is time left, it retries again and repeats the logic until it receives an acknowledgment or determines that the retry time has expired.\nIf you don't want Kinesis Data Firehose to retry sending data, set this value to 0.",

If any other supported service (other than S3 or Amazon Redshift) is set as your selected destination, then this setting indicates if you want to backup all your source data or failed data only.\n\nS3 backup bucket - this is the S3 bucket where Kinesis Data Firehose backs up your data.\n\nS3 backup bucket prefix - this is the prefix where Kinesis Data Firehose backs up your data.\n\nS3 backup bucket error output prefix - all failed data is backed up in the this S3 bucket error output prefix.\n\nBuffer hints, compression and encryption for backup - Kinesis Data Firehose uses Amazon S3 to backup all or failed only data that it attempts to deliver to your chosen destination. Kinesis Data Firehose buffers incoming data before delivering it (backing it up) to Amazon S3. You can choose a buffer size of 1\u00e2\u0080\u0093128 MiBs and a buffer interval of 60\u00e2\u0080\u0093900 seconds. The condition that is satisfied first triggers data delivery to Amazon S3. If you enable data transformation, the buffer interval applies from the time transformed data is received by Kinesis Data Firehose to the data delivery to Amazon S3. If data delivery to the destination falls behind data writing to the delivery stream, Kinesis Data Firehose raises the buffer size dynamically to catch up. This action helps ensure that all data is delivered to the destination. S3 compressions and encryption - choose GZIP, Snappy, Zip, or Hadoop-Compatible Snappy data compression, or no data compression. Snappy, Zip, and Hadoop-Compatible Snappy compression is not available for delivery streams with Amazon Redshift as the destination. \nKinesis Data Firehose supports Amazon S3 server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) for encrypting delivered data in Amazon S3. You can choose to not encrypt the data or to encrypt with a key from the list of AWS KMS keys that you own.

Then you can view the specific error logs if the Lambda invocation or data delivery fails. For more information, see Monitoring Kinesis Data Firehose Using CloudWatch Logs.\n\nPermissions - Kinesis Data Firehose uses IAM roles for all the permissions that the delivery stream needs.

The role is used to grant Kinesis Data Firehose access to various services, including your S3 bucket, AWS KMS key (if data encryption is enabled), and Lambda function (if data transformation is enabled).

You can then use Kinesis Data Firehose to read data easily from an existing data stream and load it into destinations. \nTo use a Kinesis data stream as a source, choose an existing stream in the Kinesis stream list, or choose Create new to create a new Kinesis data stream. After you create a new stream, choose Refresh to update the Kinesis stream list. If you have a large number of streams, filter the list using Filter by name. \nNoteWhen you configure a Kinesis data stream as the source of a Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream, the Kinesis Data Firehose PutRecord and PutRecordBatch operations are disabled.

Kinesis Data Firehose calls the Kinesis Data Streams GetRecords operation once per second for each shard.\nMore than one Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream can read from the same Kinesis stream. Other Kinesis applications (consumers) can also read from the same stream. Each call from any Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream or other consumer application counts against the overall throttling limit for the shard.

"text": "To set up the agent from the Amazon Linux repositories This method works only for Amazon Linux instances. Use the following command:\n\nsudo yum install \u00e2\u0080\u0093y aws-kinesis-agent Agent v 2.0.0 or later is installed on computers with operating system Amazon Linux 2 (AL2). This agent version requires Java 1.8 or later. If required Java version is not yet present, the agent installation process installs it. For more information regarding Amazon Linux 2 see https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-2/.\n\nTo set up the agent from the Amazon S3 repository\nThis method works for Red Hat Enterprise Linux, as well as Amazon Linux 2 instances because it installs the agent from the publicly available repository. Use the following command to download and install the latest version of the agent version 2.x.x: sudo yum install \u00e2\u0080\u0093y https://s3.amazonaws.com/streaming-data-agent/aws-kinesis-agent-latest.amzn2.noarch.rpm To install a specific version of the agent, specify the version number in the command. For example, the following command installs agent v 2.0.1. sudo yum install \u00e2\u0080\u0093y https://streaming-data-agent.s3.amazonaws.com/aws-kinesis-agent-2.0.1-1.amzn1.noarch.rpm If you have Java 1.7 and you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to upgrade it, you can download agent version 1.x.x, which is compatible with Java 1.7. For example, to download agent v1.1.6, you can use the following command: sudo yum install \u00e2\u0080\u0093y https://s3.amazonaws.com/streaming-data-agent/aws-kinesis-agent-1.1.6-1.amzn1.noarch.rpm The latest agent v1.x.x can be downloaded using the following command:\n\nsudo yum install \u00e2\u0080\u0093y https://s3.amazonaws.com/streaming-data-agent/aws-kinesis-agent-latest.amzn1.noarch.rpm To set up the agent from the GitHub repo\n\nFirst, make sure that you have required Java version installed, depending on agent version. Download the agent from the awslabs/amazon-kinesis-agent GitHub repo.\n\nInstall the agent by navigating to the download directory and running the following command:\n\nsudo ./setup --install",

"text": "Amazon S3\n\nThe frequency of data delivery to Amazon S3 is determined by the Amazon S3 Buffer size and Buffer interval value that you configured for your delivery stream. Kinesis Data Firehose buffers incoming data before it delivers it to Amazon S3. You can configure the values for Amazon S3 Buffer size (1\u00e2\u0080\u0093128 MB) or Buffer interval (60\u00e2\u0080\u0093900 seconds). The condition satisfied first triggers data delivery to Amazon S3. When data delivery to the destination falls behind data writing to the delivery stream, Kinesis Data Firehose raises the buffer size dynamically. It can then catch up and ensure that all data is delivered to the destination. Amazon Redshift\n\nThe frequency of data COPY operations from Amazon S3 to Amazon Redshift is determined by how fast your Amazon Redshift cluster can finish the COPY command. If there is still data to copy, Kinesis Data Firehose issues a new COPY command as soon as the previous COPY command is successfully finished by Amazon Redshift. Amazon OpenSearch Service\n\nThe frequency of data delivery to OpenSearch Service is determined by the OpenSearch Service Buffer size and Buffer interval values that you configured for your delivery stream. Kinesis Data Firehose buffers incoming data before delivering it to OpenSearch Service. You can configure the values for OpenSearch Service Buffer size (1\u00e2\u0080\u0093100 MB) or Buffer interval (60\u00e2\u0080\u0093900 seconds), and the condition satisfied first triggers data delivery to OpenSearch Service. Splunk\n\nKinesis Data Firehose buffers incoming data before delivering it to Splunk. The buffer size is 5 MB, and the buffer interval is 60 seconds. The condition satisfied first triggers data delivery to Splunk. The buffer size and interval aren't configurable. These numbers are optimal.\n\nHTTP endpoint destination\n\nKinesis Data Firehose buffers incoming data before delivering it to the specified HTTP endpoint destination. The recommended buffer size for the destination varies from service provider to service provider. For example, the recommended buffer size for Datadog is 4 MiBs and the recommended buffer size for New Relic and Sumo Logic is 1 MiB. Contact the third-party service provider whose endpoint you've chosen as your data destination for more information about their recommended buffer size.",

"text": "Amazon S3\n\nData delivery to your S3 bucket might fail for various reasons. For example, the bucket might not exist anymore, the IAM role that Kinesis Data Firehose assumes might not have access to the bucket, the network failed, or similar events. Under these conditions, Kinesis Data Firehose keeps retrying for up to 24 hours until the delivery succeeds. The maximum data storage time of Kinesis Data Firehose is 24 hours. If data delivery fails for more than 24 hours, your data is lost.\n\nAmazon Redshift\n\nFor an Amazon Redshift destination, you can specify a retry duration (0\u00e2\u0080\u00937200 seconds) when creating a delivery stream.\nData delivery to your Amazon Redshift cluster might fail for several reasons. For example, you might have an incorrect cluster configuration of your delivery stream, a cluster under maintenance, or a network failure. Under these conditions, Kinesis Data Firehose retries for the specified time duration and skips that particular batch of Amazon S3 objects. The skipped objects' information is delivered to your S3 bucket as a manifest file in the errors/ folder, which you can use for manual backfill. For information about how to COPY data manually with manifest files, see Using a Manifest to Specify Data Files. Amazon OpenSearch Service\n\nFor the OpenSearch Service destination, you can specify a retry duration (0\u00e2\u0080\u00937200 seconds) when creating a delivery stream.\nData delivery to your OpenSearch Service cluster might fail for several reasons. For example, you might have an incorrect OpenSearch Service cluster configuration of your delivery stream, an OpenSearch Service cluster under maintenance, a network failure, or similar events. Under these conditions, Kinesis Data Firehose retries for the specified time duration and then skips that particular index request. The skipped documents are delivered to your S3 bucket in the AmazonOpenSearchService_failed/ folder, which you can use for manual backfill. Each document has the following JSON format:\n{ \"attemptsMade\": \"(number of index requests attempted)\", \"arrivalTimestamp\": \"(the time when the document was received by Firehose)\", \"errorCode\": \"(http error code returned by OpenSearch Service)\", \"errorMessage\": \"(error message returned by OpenSearch Service)\", \"attemptEndingTimestamp\": \"(the time when Firehose stopped attempting index request)\", \"esDocumentId\": \"(intended OpenSearch Service document ID)\", \"esIndexName\": \"(intended OpenSearch Service index name)\", \"esTypeName\": \"(intended OpenSearch Service type name)\", \"rawData\": \"(base64-encoded document data)\"\n}\n\nSplunk\n\nWhen Kinesis Data Firehose sends data to Splunk, it waits for an acknowledgment from Splunk. If an error occurs, or the acknowledgment doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t arrive within the acknowledgment timeout period, Kinesis Data Firehose starts the retry duration counter. It keeps retrying until the retry duration expires. After that, Kinesis Data Firehose considers it a data delivery failure and backs up the data to your Amazon S3 bucket. \nEvery time Kinesis Data Firehose sends data to Splunk, whether it's the initial attempt or a retry, it restarts the acknowledgement timeout counter. It then waits for an acknowledgement to arrive from Splunk. Even if the retry duration expires, Kinesis Data Firehose still waits for the acknowledgment until it receives it or the acknowledgement timeout is reached. If the acknowledgment times out, Kinesis Data Firehose checks to determine whether there's time left in the retry counter. If there is time left, it retries again and repeats the logic until it receives an acknowledgment or determines that the retry time has expired.\nA failure to receive an acknowledgement isn't the only type of data delivery error that can occur. For information about the other types of data delivery errors, see Splunk Data Delivery Errors. Any data delivery error triggers the retry logic if your retry duration is greater than 0.\nThe following is an example error record.\n{ \"attemptsMade\": 0, \"arrivalTimestamp\": 1506035354675, \"errorCode\": \"Splunk.AckTimeout\", \"errorMessage\": \"Did not receive an acknowledgement from HEC before the HEC acknowledgement timeout expired. Despite the acknowledgement timeout, it's possible the data was indexed successfully in Splunk. Kinesis Firehose backs up in Amazon S3 data for which the acknowledgement timeout expired.\", \"attemptEndingTimestamp\": 13626284715507, \"rawData\": \"MiAyNTE2MjAyNzIyMDkgZW5pLTA1ZjMyMmQ1IDIxOC45Mi4xODguMjE0IDE3Mi4xNi4xLjE2NyAyNTIzMyAxNDMzIDYgMSA0MCAxNTA2MDM0NzM0IDE1MDYwMzQ3OTQgUkVKRUNUIE9LCg==\", \"EventId\": \"49577193928114147339600778471082492393164139877200035842.0\"\n}\n\nHTTP endpoint destination\n\nWhen Kinesis Data Firehose sends data to an HTTP endpoint destination, it waits for a response from this destination. If an error occurs, or the response doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t arrive within the response timeout period, Kinesis Data Firehose starts the retry duration counter. It keeps retrying until the retry duration expires. After that, Kinesis Data Firehose considers it a data delivery failure and backs up the data to your Amazon S3 bucket. \nEvery time Kinesis Data Firehose sends data to an HTTP endpoint destination, whether it's the initial attempt or a retry, it restarts the response timeout counter. It then waits for a response to arrive from the HTTP endpoint destination. Even if the retry duration expires, Kinesis Data Firehose still waits for the response until it receives it or the response timeout is reached. If the response times out, Kinesis Data Firehose checks to determine whether there's time left in the retry counter.

"text": "For the timestamp namespace, any character that isn't in single quotes is evaluated. In other words, any string escaped with single quotes in the value field is taken literally.\n\nIf you specify a prefix that doesn't contain a timestamp namespace expression, Kinesis Data Firehose appends the expression !{timestamp:yyyy/MM/dd/HH/}to the value in the Prefix field.\n\nThe sequence !{ can only appear in !{namespace:value} expressions.\n\nErrorOutputPrefix can be null only if Prefix contains no expressions. In this case, Prefix evaluates to <specified-prefix>yyyy/MM/DDD/HH/ and ErrorOutputPrefix evaluates to <specified-prefix><error-output-type>YYYY/MM/DDD/HH/. DDD represents the day of the year.\n\nIf you specify an expression for ErrorOutputPrefix, you must include at least one instance of !{firehose:error-output-type}.\n\nPrefix can't contain !{firehose:error-output-type}.\n\nNeither Prefix nor ErrorOutputPrefix can be greater than 512 characters after they're evaluated.\n\nIf the destination is Amazon Redshift, Prefix must not contain expressions and ErrorOutputPrefix must be null.\n\nWhen the destination is Amazon OpenSearch Service or Splunk, and no ErrorOutputPrefix is specified, Kinesis Data Firehose uses the Prefix field for failed records. When the destination is Amazon S3, the Prefix and ErrorOutputPrefix in the Amazon S3 destination configuration are used for successful records and failed records, respectively. If you use the AWS CLI or the API, you can use ExtendedS3DestinationConfiguration to specify an Amazon S3 backup configuration with its own Prefix and ErrorOutputPrefix.\n\nWhen you use the AWS Management Console and set the destination to Amazon S3, Kinesis Data Firehose uses the Prefix and ErrorOutputPrefix in the destination configuration for successful records and failed records, respectively. If you specify a prefix but no error prefix, Kinesis Data Firehose automatically sets the error prefix to !{firehose:error-output-type}/.\n\nWhen you use ExtendedS3DestinationConfiguration with the AWS CLI, the API, or AWS CloudFormation, if you specify a S3BackupConfiguration, Kinesis Data Firehose doesn't provide a default ErrorOutputPrefix.\n\nYou cannot use partitionKeyFromLambda and partitionKeyFromQuery namespaces when creating ErrorOutputPrefix expressions.",

On the AWS Lambda console, for the function name, enter VPCtoSplunkLambda.\n\nIn the description text under Execution role, choose the IAM console link to create a custom role. This opens the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) console.\n\nIn the IAM console, choose Lambda.\n\nChoose Next: Permissions.\n\nChoose Create policy.\n\nChoose the JSON tab and replace the existing JSON with the following. Be sure to replace the your-region and your-aws-account-id placeholders with your AWS Region code and account ID. Don't include any hyphens or dashes in the account ID. For a list of AWS Region codes, see AWS Regions and Endpoints.\n{ \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": [ \"firehose:PutRecordBatch\" ], \"Resource\": [ \"arn:aws:firehose:your-region:your-aws-account-id:deliverystream/VPCtoSplunkStream\" ] } ]\n}\nThis policy allows the Lambda function to put data back into the delivery stream by invoking the PutRecordBatch operation. This step is needed because a Lambda function can only return up to 6 MiB of data every time Kinesis Data Firehose invokes it. If the size of the uncompressed data exceeds 6 MiB, the function invokes PutRecordBatch to put some of the data back into the delivery stream for future processing. Back in the Create role window, refresh the list of policies, then choose VPCtoSplunkLambdaPolicy by selecting the box to its left.\n\nChoose Next: Tags.\n\nChoose Next: Review.\n\nFor Role Name, enter VPCtoSplunkLambdaRole, then choose Create role.\n\nBack in the Lambda console, refresh the list of existing roles, then select VPCtoSplunkLambdaRole.\n\nScroll down and choose Create function.\n\nIn the Lambda function pane, scroll down to the Basic settings section, and increase the timeout to 3 minutes.\n\nScroll up and choose Save.\n\nBack in the Choose Lambda blueprint dialog box, choose Close.\n\nOn the delivery stream creation page, under the Transform source records with AWS Lambda section, choose the refresh button. Then choose VPCtoSplunkLambda in the list of functions.\n\nScroll down and choose Next.\n\nFor Destination*, choose Splunk.\n\nFor Splunk cluster endpoint, see the information at Configure Amazon Kinesis Firehose to send data to the Splunk platform in the Splunk documentation.\n\nKeep Splunk endpoint type set to Raw endpoint.\n\nEnter the value (and not the name) of your Splunk HTTP Event Collector (HEC) token.\n\nFor S3 backup mode*, choose Backup all events.\n\nChoose an existing Amazon S3 bucket (or create a new one if you want), and choose Next.\n\nOn the Configure settings page, scroll down to the IAM role section, and choose Create new or choose.\n\nIn the IAM role list, choose Create a new IAM role.

Kinesis Data Firehose does not support Application Load Balancers or Network Load Balancers. Also, enable duration-based sticky sessions with cookie expiration disabled. For information about how to do this, see Duration-Based Session Stickiness.\n\nReview the Splunk platform requirements. The Splunk add-on for Kinesis Data Firehose requires Splunk platform version 6.6.X or later. For more information, see Splunk Add-on for Amazon Kinesis Firehose.\n\nIf you have a proxy (Elastic Load Balancing or other) between Kinesis Data Firehose and the HTTP Event Collector (HEC) node, enable sticky sessions to support HEC acknowledgements (ACKs).\n\nMake sure that you are using a valid HEC token.\n\nEnsure that the HEC token is enabled. See Enable and disable Event Collector tokens.\n\nCheck whether the data that you're sending to Splunk is formatted correctly. For more information, see Format events for HTTP Event Collector.\n\nMake sure that the HEC token and input event are configured with a valid index.\n\nWhen an upload to Splunk fails due to a server error from the HEC node, the request is automatically retried. If all retries fail, the data gets backed up to Amazon S3. Check if your data appears in Amazon S3, which is an indication of such a failure.\n\nMake sure that you enabled indexer acknowledgment on your HEC token. For more information, see Enable indexer acknowledgement.\n\nIncrease the value of HECAcknowledgmentTimeoutInSeconds in the Splunk destination configuration of your Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream.\n\nIncrease the value of DurationInSeconds under RetryOptions in the Splunk destination configuration of your Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream.\n\nCheck your HEC health.\n\nIf you're using data transformation, make sure that your Lambda function never returns responses whose payload size exceeds 6 MB. For more information, see Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose Data Transformation.\n\nMake sure that the Splunk parameter named ackIdleCleanup is set to true. It is false by default. To set this parameter to true, do the following: For a managed Splunk Cloud deployment, submit a case using the Splunk support portal. In this case, ask Splunk support to enable the HTTP event collector, set ackIdleCleanup to true in inputs.conf, and create or modify a load balancer to use with this add-on.\n\nFor a distributed Splunk Enterprise deployment, set the ackIdleCleanup parameter to true in the inputs.conf file. For *nix users, this file is located under $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/splunk_httpinput/local/. For Windows users, it is under %SPLUNK_HOME%\\etc\\apps\\splunk_httpinput\\local\\.\n\nFor a single-instance Splunk Enterprise deployment, set the ackIdleCleanup parameter to true in the inputs.conf file. For *nix users, this file is located under $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/splunk_httpinput/local/. For Windows users, it is under %SPLUNK_HOME%\\etc\\apps\\splunk_httpinput\\local\\.

"text": "The destination can't handle the rate of delivery. If Kinesis Data Firehose encounters transient errors due to high traffic, then the delivery might fall behind. This can happen for destinations other than Amazon S3 (it can happen for OpenSearch Service, Amazon Redshift, or Splunk). Ensure that your destination has enough capacity to handle the incoming traffic.\n\nThe destination is slow. Data delivery might fall behind if Kinesis Data Firehose encounters high latency. Monitor the destination's latency metric.\n\nThe Lambda function is slow. This might lead to a data delivery rate that is less than the data ingestion rate for the delivery stream. If possible, improve the efficiency of the Lambda function. For instance, if the function does network IO, use multiple threads or asynchronous IO to increase parallelism. Also, consider increasing the memory size of the Lambda function so that the CPU allocation can increase accordingly. This might lead to faster Lambda invocations. For information about configuring Lambda functions, see Configuring AWS Lambda Functions.\n\nThere are failures during data delivery. For information about how to monitor errors using Amazon CloudWatch Logs, see Monitoring Kinesis Data Firehose Using CloudWatch Logs.\n\nIf the data source of the delivery stream is a Kinesis data stream, throttling might be happening. Check the ThrottledGetRecords, ThrottledGetShardIterator, and ThrottledDescribeStream metrics. If there are multiple consumers attached to the Kinesis data stream, consider the following: If the ThrottledGetRecords and ThrottledGetShardIterator metrics are high, we recommend you increase the number of shards provisioned for the data stream.\n\nIf the ThrottledDescribeStream is high, we recommend you add the kinesis:listshards permission to the role configured in KinesisStreamSourceConfiguration. Low buffering hints for the destination. This might increase the number of round trips that Kinesis Data Firehose needs to make to the destination, which might cause delivery to fall behind. Consider increasing the value of the buffering hints. For more information, see BufferingHints.\n\nA high retry duration might cause delivery to fall behind when the errors are frequent. Consider reducing the retry duration. Also, monitor the errors and try to reduce them. For information about how to monitor errors using Amazon CloudWatch Logs, see Monitoring Kinesis Data Firehose Using CloudWatch Logs.\n\nIf the destination is Splunk and DeliveryToSplunk.DataFreshness is high but DeliveryToSplunk.Success looks good, the Splunk cluster might be busy. Free the Splunk cluster if possible. Alternatively, contact AWS Support and request an increase in the number of channels that Kinesis Data Firehose is using to communicate with the Splunk cluster.",

"text": "When dynamic partitioning on a delivery stream is enabled, there is a limit of 500 active partitions that can be created for that delivery stream. You can use the Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose Limits form to request an increase of this quota. When dynamic partitioning on a delivery stream is enabled, a max throughput of 40 MB per second is supported for each active partition. This is a hard limit.\n\nBy default, each account can have up to 50 Kinesis Data Firehose delivery streams per Region. If you exceed this number, a call to CreateDeliveryStream results in a LimitExceededException exception. To increase this quota, you can use Service Quotas if it's available in your Region. For information about using Service Quotas, see Requesting a Quota Increase. If Service Quotas isn't available in your region, you can use the Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose Limits form to request an increase.\n\nWhen Direct PUT is configured as the data source, each Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream provides the following combined quota for PutRecord and PutRecordBatch requests: For US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), and Europe (Ireland): 500,000 records/second, 2,000 requests/second, and 5 MiB/second.\n\nFor US East (Ohio), US West (N. California), AWS GovCloud (US-East), AWS GovCloud (US-West), Asia Pacific (Hong Kong), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Canada (Central), Europe (Frankfurt), Europe (London), Europe (Paris), Europe (Stockholm), Middle East (Bahrain), South America (S\u00c3\u00a3o Paulo), Africa (Cape Town), and Europe (Milan): 100,000 records/second, 1,000 requests/second, and 1 MiB/second. To request an increase in quota, use the Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose Limits form. The three quota scale proportionally. For example, if you increase the throughput quota in US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), or Europe (Ireland) to 10 MiB/second, the other two quota increase to 4,000 requests/second and 1,000,000 records/second.\nImportantIf the increased quota is much higher than the running traffic, it causes small delivery batches to destinations. This is inefficient and can result in higher costs at the destination services. Be sure to increase the quota only to match current running traffic, and increase the quota further if traffic increases.\nImportantNote that smaller data records can lead to higher costs. Kinesis Data Firehose ingestion pricing is based on the number of data records you send to the service, times the size of each record rounded up to the nearest 5KB (5120 bytes). So, for the same volume of incoming data (bytes), if there is a greater number of incoming records, the cost incurred would be higher. For example, if the total incoming data volume is 5MiB, sending 5MiB of data over 5,000 records costs more compared to sending the same amount of data using 1,000 records. For more information, see Kinesis Data Firehose in the AWS Calculator.\nNoteWhen Kinesis Data Streams is configured as the data source, this quota doesn't apply, and Kinesis Data Firehose scales up and down with no limit. Each Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream stores data records for up to 24 hours in case the delivery destination is unavailable and if the source is DirectPut. If the source is Kinesis Data Streams (KDS) and the destination is unavailable, then the data will be retained based on your KDS configuration.\n\nThe maximum size of a record sent to Kinesis Data Firehose, before base64-encoding, is 1,000 KiB.\n\nThe PutRecordBatch operation can take up to 500 records per call or 4 MiB per call, whichever is smaller. This quota cannot be changed.\n\nThe following operations can provide up to five invocations per second (this is a hard limit): CreateDeliveryStream, DeleteDeliveryStream, DescribeDeliveryStream, ListDeliveryStreams, UpdateDestination, TagDeliveryStream, UntagDeliveryStream, ListTagsForDeliveryStream, StartDeliveryStreamEncryption, StopDeliveryStreamEncryption. The buffer sizes hints range from 1 MiB to 128 MiB for Amazon S3 delivery. For Amazon OpenSearch Service (OpenSearch Service) delivery, they range from 1 MiB to 100 MiB. For AWS Lambda processing, you can set a buffering hint between 1 MiB and 3 MiB using the BufferSizeInMBs processor parameter. The size threshold is applied to the buffer before compression. These options are treated as hints. Kinesis Data Firehose might choose to use different values when it is optimal. The buffer interval hints range from 60 seconds to 900 seconds.\n\nFor delivery from Kinesis Data Firehose to Amazon Redshift, only publicly accessible Amazon Redshift clusters are supported.\n\nThe retry duration range is from 0 seconds to 7,200 seconds for Amazon Redshift and OpenSearch Service delivery.\n\nKinesis Data Firehose supports Elasticsearch versions 1.5, 2.3, 5.1, 5.3, 5.5, 5.6, as well as all 6.* and 7.* versions and Amazon OpenSearch Service 1.x and later.\n\nWhen the destination is Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, or OpenSearch Service, Kinesis Data Firehose allows up to 5 outstanding Lambda invocations per shard. For Splunk, the quota is 10 outstanding Lambda invocations per shard. You can use a CMK of type CUSTOMER_MANAGED_CMK to encrypt up to 500 delivery streams.",

"text": "Path and URL Parameters\n\nThese are configured directly by you as part of a single URL field. Kinesis Data Firehose sends them as configured without modification. Only https destinations are supported. URL restrictions are applied during delivery-stream configuration.\nNoteCurrently, only port 443 is supported for HTTP endpoint data delivery.\n\nHTTP Headers - X-Amz-Firehose-Protocol-Version\n\nThis header is used to indicate the version of the request/response formats. Currently the only version is 1.0.\n\nHTTP Headers - X-Amz-Firehose-Request-Id\n\nThe value of this header is an opaque GUID that can be used for debugging and deduplication purposes. Endpoint implementations should log the value of this header if possible, for both successful and unsuccessful requests. The request ID is kept the same between multiple attempts of the same request.\n\nHTTP Headers - Content-Type\n\nThe value of the Content-Type header is always application/json.\n\nHTTP Headers - Content-Encoding\n\nA Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream can be configured to use GZIP to compress the body when sending requests. When this compression is enabled, the value of the Content-Encoding header is set to gzip, as per standard practice. If compression is not enabled, the Content-Encoding header is absent altogether.\n\nHTTP Headers - Content-Length\n\nThis is used in the standard way.\n\nHTTP Headers - X-Amz-Firehose-Source-Arn:\n\nThe ARN of the Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream represented in ASCII string format. The ARN encodes region, AWS account ID and the stream name. For example, arn:aws:firehose:us-east-1:123456789:deliverystream/testStream. HTTP Headers - X-Amz-Firehose-Access-Key\n\nThis header carries an API key or other credentials. You have the ability to create or update the API-key (aka authorization token) when creating or updating your delivery-stream. Kinesis Data Firehose restricts the size of the access key to 4096 bytes. Kinesis Data Firehose does not attempt to interpret this key in any way. The configured key is copied verbatim into the value of this header. \nThe contents can be arbitrary and can potentially represent a JWT token or an ACCESS_KEY. If an endpoint requires multi-field credentials (for example, username and password), the values of all of the fields should be stored together within a single access-key in a format that the endpoint understands (JSON or CSV). This field can be base-64 encoded if the original contents are binary. Kinesis Data Firehose does not modifiy and/or encode the configured value and uses the contents as is.\n\nHTTP Headers - X-Amz-Firehose-Common-Attributes\n\nThis header carries the common attributes (metadata) that pertain to the entire request, and/or to all records within the request. These are configured directly by you when creating a delivery stream. The value of this attribute is encoded as a JSON object with the following schema: \"$schema\": http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#\n\nproperties: commonAttributes: type: object minProperties: 0 maxProperties: 50 patternProperties: \"^.{1,256}$\": type: string minLength: 0 maxLength: 1024 Here's an example:\n\n\"commonAttributes\": { \"deployment -context\": \"pre-prod-gamma\", \"device-types\": \"\" } Body - Max Size\n\nThe maximum body size is configured by you, and can be up to a maximum of 64 MiB, before compression.\n\nBody - Schema\n\nThe body carries a single JSON document with the following JSON Schema (written in YAML):\n\n\"$schema\": http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#\n\ntitle: FirehoseCustomHttpsEndpointRequest\ndescription: > The request body that the Firehose service sends to custom HTTPS endpoints.\ntype: object\nproperties: requestId: description: > Same as the value in the X-Amz-Firehose-Request-Id header, duplicated here for convenience. type: string timestamp: description: > The timestamp (milliseconds since epoch) at which the Firehose server generated this request. type: integer records: description: > The actual records of the Delivery Stream, carrying the customer data. type: array minItems: 1 maxItems: 10000 items: type: object properties: data: description: > The data of this record, in Base64.

"text": "Default Behavior on Error\n\nIf a response fails to conform to the requirements below, the Kinesis Firehose server treats it as though it had a 500 status code with no body.\n\nStatus Code\n\nThe HTTP status code MUST be in the 2XX, 4XX or 5XX range.\nThe Kinesis Data Firehose server does NOT follow redirects (3XX status codes). Only response code 200 is considered as a successful delivery of the records to HTTP/EP. Response code 413 (size exceeded) is considered as a permanent failure and the record batch is not sent to error bucket if configured. All other response codes are considered as retriable errors and are subjected to back-off retry algorithm explained later. Headers - Content Type\n\nThe only acceptable content type is application/json.\n\nHTTP Headers - Content-Encoding\n\nContent-Encoding MUST NOT be used. The body MUST be uncompressed.\n\nHTTP Headers - Content-Length\n\nThe Content-Length header MUST be present if the response has a body.\n\nBody - Max Size\n\nThe response body must be 1 MiB or less in size.\n\n\"$schema\": http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#\n\ntitle: FirehoseCustomHttpsEndpointResponse\n\ndescription: > The response body that the Firehose service sends to custom HTTPS endpoints.\ntype: object\nproperties: requestId: description: > Must match the requestId in the request. type: string timestamp: description: > The timestamp (milliseconds since epoch) at which the server processed this request. type: integer errorMessage: description: > For failed requests, a message explaining the failure.

The retries are backed off using an initial back-off time (1 second) with a jitter factor of (15%) and each subsequent retry is backed off using the formula (initial-backoff-time * (multiplier(2) ^ retry_count)) with added jitter. The backoff time is capped by a maximum interval of 2 minutes. For example on the \u00e2\u0080\u0098n\u00e2\u0080\u0099-th retry the back off time is = MAX(120sec, (1 * (2^n)) * random(0.85, 1,15).\nThe parameters specified in the previous equation are subject to change. Refer to the AWS Firehose documentation for exact initial back off time, max backoff time, multiplier and jitter percentages used in exponential back off algorithm.\nIn each subsequent retry attempt the access key and/or destination to which records are delivered might change based on updated configuration of the delivery stream. Kinesis Data Firehose service uses the same request-id across retries in a best-effort manner. This last feature can be used for deduplication purpose by the HTTP end point server. If the request is still not delivered after the maximum time allowed (based on delivery stream configuration) the batch of records can optionally be delivered to an error bucket based on stream configuration.",
