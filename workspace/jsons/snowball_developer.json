This depends on the options you choose when you create your job.\n\nNetwork adapters with transfer speeds of up to 100 Gbit/second.\n\nEncryption is enforced, protecting your data at rest and in physical transit.\n\nYou can import or export data between your local environments and Amazon S3, and physically transport the data with one or more devices without using the internet.\n\nSnowball Edge devices are their own rugged box. The built-in E Ink display changes to show your shipping label when the device is ready to ship.\n\nSnowball Edge devices come with an on-board LCD display that can be used to manage network connections and get service status information.\n\nYou can cluster Snowball Edge devices for local storage and compute jobs to achieve data durability across 5\u00e2\u0080\u009310 devices and locally grow or shrink storage on demand.\n\nYou can use the file interface to read and write data to an AWS Snowball Edge device through a file share or Network File System (NFS) mount point.\n\nYou can write Python-language Lambda functions and associate them with Amazon S3 buckets when you create an AWS Snowball Edge device job. Each function triggers when a local Amazon S3 PUT object action is run on the associated bucket on the device.\n\nSnowball Edge devices have Amazon S3 and Amazon EC2 compatible endpoints available, enabling programmatic use cases.\n\nSnowball Edge devices support the new sbe1, sbe-c, and sbe-g instance types, which you can use to run compute instances on the device using Amazon Machine Images (AMIs).",

"text": "The shared workflow\n\nCreate the job \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Each job is created in the AWS Snow Family Management Console or programmatically through the job management API. The status for a job can be tracked in the console or through the API.\n\nA device is prepared for your job \u00e2\u0080\u0093 We prepare an AWS Snowball Edge device for your job, and the status of your job is now Preparing Snowball.\n\nA device is shipped to you by your region's carrier \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The carrier takes over from here, and the status of your job is now In transit to you. You can find your tracking number and a link to the tracking website on the console or with the job management API. For information about who your region's carrier is, see Shipping Considerations for AWS Snowball.\n\nReceive the device \u00e2\u0080\u0093 A few days later, your region's carrier delivers the AWS Snowball Edge device to the address that you provided when you created the job, and the status of your job changes to Delivered to you. When it arrives, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll notice that it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t arrive in a box, because the device is its own shipping container.\n\nGet your credentials and download the Snowball Edge client \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Get ready to start transferring data by getting your credentials, your job manifest, and the manifest's unlock code, and then downloading the Snowball Edge client. The 8 client is the tool that you use to manage the flow of data from the device to your on-premises data destination.\nYou can download and install the Snowball Edge client from the AWS Snowball resources page.\nYou must download the Snowball Edge client from the AWS Snowball Edge Resources page and install on a powerful workstation that you own.\n\nThe manifest is used to authenticate your access to the device, and it is encrypted so that only the unlock code can decrypt it. You can get the manifest from the console or with the job management API when the device is on-premises at your location.\n\nThe unlock code is a 29-character code used to decrypt the manifest. You can get the unlock code from the console or with the job management API. We recommend that you keep the unlock code saved somewhere separate from the manifest to prevent unauthorized access to the device while it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at your facility. Position the hardware \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Move the device into your data center and open it following the instructions on the case. Connect the device to power and your local network.\n\nPower on the device \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Next, power on the device by pressing the power button above the LCD display. Wait a few minutes, and the Ready screen appears.\n\nGet the IP address for the device \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The LCD display has a CONNECTION tab on it. Tap this tab and get the IP address for the AWS Snowball Edge device.\n\nUse the Snowball Edge client to unlock the device \u00e2\u0080\u0093 When you use the Snowball Edge client to unlock the AWS Snowball Edge device, enter the IP address of the device, the path to your manifest, and the unlock code. The Snowball Edge client decrypts the manifest and uses it to authenticate your access to the device.\n\nUse the device \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The device is up and running. You can use it to transfer data or for local compute and storage. You can read and write data with the Amazon S3 interface or the Network File System (NFS) mount point.\n\nPrepare the device for its return trip \u00e2\u0080\u0093 After you're done with the device in your on-premises location and the file interface status is Complete, press the power button above the LCD display. It takes about 20 seconds or so for the device to power off. Unplug the device and its power cables into the cable nook on top of the device, and shut all three of the device's doors. The device is now ready to be returned.\n\nYour region's carrier returns the device to AWS \u00e2\u0080\u0093 When the carrier has the AWS Snowball Edge device, the status for the job becomes In transit to AWS.\nNoteThere are additional steps for export and cluster jobs.

On the next page, enter your password.\nNoteWe strongly recommend that you adhere to the best practice of using the Administrator IAM user that follows and securely lock away the root user credentials. Sign in as the root user only to perform a few account and service management tasks.\n\nIn the navigation pane, choose Users and then choose Add users.\n\nFor User name, enter Administrator.\n\nSelect the check box next to AWS Management Console access. Then select Custom password, and then enter your new password in the text box.\n\n(Optional) By default, AWS requires the new user to create a new password when first signing in. You can clear the check box next to User must create a new password at next sign-in to allow the new user to reset their password after they sign in.\n\nChoose Next: Permissions.\n\nUnder Set permissions, choose Add user to group.\n\nChoose Create group.\n\nIn the Create group dialog box, for Group name enter Administrators.\n\nChoose Filter policies, and then select AWS managed - job function to filter the table contents.\n\nIn the policy list, select the check box for AdministratorAccess. Then choose Create group.\nNoteYou must activate IAM user and role access to Billing before you can use the AdministratorAccess permissions to access the AWS Billing and Cost Management console. To do this, follow the instructions in step 1 of the tutorial about delegating access to the billing console.\n\nBack in the list of groups, select the check box for your new group.

"text": "What data are you transferring?\n\nTransferring a large number of small files does not work well with AWS Snowball Edge. This is because Snowball Edge encrypts each individual object. Small files include files under 1 MB in size. We recommend that you zip them up before transferring them onto the AWS Snowball Edge device. We also recommend that you have no more than 500,000 files or directories within each directory.\n\nWill the data be accessed during the transfer?\n\nIt is important to have a static dataset, (that is, no users or systems are accessing the data during transfer). If not, the file transfer can fail due to a checksum mismatch. The files won't be transferred and the files will be marked as Failed. \nWe recommend that if you are using the file interface, you only use one method of transferring data to the AWS Snowball Edge. Copying data with both the file interface and the Amazon S3 interface can result in read/write conflicts. \nTo prevent corrupting your data, don't disconnect an AWS Snowball Edge device or change its network settings while transferring data. Files should be in a static state while being written to the device. Files that are modified while they are being written to the device can result in read/write conflicts.\n\nWill the network support AWS Snowball data transfer?\n\nSnowball Edge supports the RJ45, SFP+, or QSFP+ networking adapters. Verify that your switch is a gigabit switch. Depending on the brand of switch, it might say gigabit or 10/100/1000. Snowball Edge devices do not support a megabit switch, or 10/100 switch.",

Choose Actions, choose Image, and then choose Create image.\nTipIf this option isn't available, your instance isn't an Amazon EBS-backed instance.\n\nIn the Create Image dialog box, specify the following information, and then choose Create image. Image name - A unique name for the image.\n\nImage description - An optional description of the image, up to 255 characters.\n\nNo reboot - This option is not selected by default. Amazon EC2 shuts down the instance, takes snapshots of any attached volumes, creates and registers the AMI, and then reboots the instance. Select No reboot to avoid having your instance shut down.\nWarningIf you select No reboot, we can't guarantee the file system integrity of the created image.\n\nInstance Volumes - The fields in this section enable you to modify the root volume, and add more Amazon EBS and instance store volumes. For information about each field, pause on the i icon next to each field to display field tooltips. Some important points are listed following: To change the size of the root volume, locate Root in the Volume Type column. For Size (GiB), enter the required value.\n\nIf you select Delete on Termination, when you terminate the instance created from this AMI, the Amazon EBS volume is deleted. If you clear Delete on Termination, when you terminate the instance, the Amazon EBS volume is not deleted. For more information, see Preserving Amazon EBS volumes on instance termination in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.\n\nTo add an Amazon EBS volume, choose Add New Volume (which adds a new row). For Volume Type, choose EBS, and fill in the fields in the row. When you launch an instance from your new AMI, additional volumes are automatically attached to the instance. Empty volumes must be formatted and mounted. Volumes based on a snapshot must be mounted.\n\nTo add an instance store volume, see Adding instance store volumes to an AMI in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances. When you launch an instance from your new AMI, additional volumes are automatically initialized and mounted. These volumes don't contain data from the instance store volumes of the running instance on which you based your AMI. To view the status of your AMI while it is being created, in the navigation pane, choose AMIs. Initially, the status is pending but should change to available after a few minutes.\n(Optional) To view the snapshot that was created for the new AMI, choose Snapshots. When you launch an instance from this AMI, we use this snapshot to create its root device volume.\n\nLaunch an instance from your new AMI. For more information, see Launching an instance using the Launch Instance Wizard in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.\n\nThe new running instance contains all of the customizations that you applied in previous steps.",

"text": "We recommend that you have a redundant power supply to reduce potential performance and stability issues for your cluster.\n\nLike standalone local storage and compute jobs, the data stored in a cluster can't be imported into Amazon S3 without ordering additional devices as a part of separate import jobs. If you order these devices, you can transfer the data from the cluster to the devices and import the data when you return the devices for the import jobs.\n\nTo get data onto a cluster from Amazon S3, create a separate export job and copy the data from the devices of the export job onto the cluster.\n\nYou can use the console, the AWS CLI, or AWS SDK to create a cluster job.\n\nCluster nodes have node IDs. A node ID is the same as the job ID for a device that you can get from the console, the AWS CLI, the AWS SDKs, or the Snowball Edge client. You can use node IDs to remove old nodes from clusters. You can get a list of node IDs by using the snowballEdge describe-device command on an unlocked device or the describe-cluster on an unlocked cluster.\n\nThe lifespan of a cluster is limited by the security certificate granted to the cluster devices when the cluster is provisioned.\n\nWhen AWS receives a returned device that was part of a cluster, we perform a complete erasure of the device. This erasure follows the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 800-88 standards.",

If this is your first time creating a job in this AWS Region, you will see the AWS Snow Family page. Otherwise you will see the list of pre-existing jobs. If this is your first job, choose Order an AWS Snow family device, or if you are expecting multiple jobs to migrate over 500 TB of data, choose Create your large data migration plan greater than 500 TB, otherwise choose Create Job located in the left navigation bar. Choose Next step to open the Plan your job page.\n\nDepending on your use case, choose one of the following job types: Import into Amazon S3 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Choose this option to have ship an empty Snowball Edge device to you. You connect the device to your local network and run the Snowball Edge client. You copy data onto the device using NFS share, ship it back to AWS, and your data is uploaded to AWS.\n\nExport from Amazon S3 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Choose this option to export data from your Amazon S3 bucket to your device. AWS loads your data on the device and ships it to you. You connect the device to your local network and run the Snowball Edge client. You copy data from your device to your servers. When you are done, ship the device to AWS, and your data is erased from the device.\n\nLocal compute and storage only \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Choose this option to perform compute and storage workloads on the device without transferring any data. To increase storage capacity and durability, you can order multiple devices in a cluster.\nIf you choose Local compute and storage only, and if you want to create a cluster, enter a name for the cluster and the number of devices that you want in the cluster. The number of devices must be between 5 and 10 in the Make this a cluster - optional section. For more information about clusters, see Using a Snowball Edge Cluster.\n\nChoose Next to continue.",

Snow Family devices use VM Import/Export to import snapshots. AWS assumes this role and uses it to import the snapshot on your behalf. If you don't have a role, open the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) console, where you can create role. The role also needs a policy that has the required VM Import/Export permissions to perform the import. You must attach this policy to the role. \nThe following is an example of the policy.\n{ \"Version\":\"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\":[ { \"Effect\":\"Allow\", \"Principal\":{ \"Service\":\"vmie.amazonaws.com\" }, \"Action\":\"sts:AssumeRole\" } ]\n}\nSign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.\nThe role you create should have minimum permissions to access Amazon S3 The following is example of a minimum policy. \n{ \"Version\":\"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\":[ { \"Effect\":\"Allow\", \"Action\":[ \"s3:GetBucketLocation\", \"s3:GetObject\", \"s3:ListBucket\", \"s3:GetMetadata\" ], \"Resource\":[ \"arn:aws:s3:::import-snapshot-bucket-name\", \"arn:aws:s3:::import-snapshot-bucket-name/*\" ] } ]\n}\nChoose Browse S3 and choose the S3 bucket that contains the snapshot that you want to import.

The Physical network interface field is populated.\n\nChoose Create IP address (VNI) or choose Use existing IP address.\n\nIf you choose Create IP address (VNI), then choose DHCP or Static IP in the IP Address assignment list box.\nImportantIf you use a DHCP network, it is possible that the NFS client's IP address could be reassigned by the DCHP server. This can happen after the device has been disconnected and the IP addresses are recycled. If you set an allowed host range and the address of the client changes, another client can pick up that address. In this case, the new client will have access to the share. To prevent this, use DHCP reservations or static IP addresses.\nIf you choose Use existing IP address, then choose a virtual interface from the Virtual network interface list box.\n\nRestrict NFS to allowed hosts is selected by default. This restricts access to the NFS service to hosts you allow but you can choose Allow all hosts. We recommend restricting access. For more information about using NFS, see Using NFS for Offline Data Transfer.\n\nIn the Allowed hosts text box, provide the CIDR blocks of hosts that you want to allow to connect to the NFS service. For example, 10.0.0.0/16.\n\nChoose Add allowed host to add more hosts to allow.\n\nChoose Start NFS. It could take about a minute or two to start. NFS uses 1 GB of ram and one of your CPUs. This limits the number of instances available.\nImportantDon't turn off your device while the service is starting.\nFrom the Network File System (NFS) resource section, the State of the NFS service shows as Active. Use the copy icon to copy the IP address of the NFS service. You will need this IP address for connect your NFS service when are ready to transfer files.\nIn the Mount paths box, you can filter and look for your endpoints.\n\nFor Endpoint name, choose an endpoint from the list, and choose Mount NFS endpoint. In Linux, mounting and unmount NFS endpoints requires root permissions. This endpoint is configured with the S3 bucket you specified when you ordered the device. The endpoint is shown under NFS endpoints. The endpoint is configured as an NFS file and shares. It appears as a drive letter and you can use your native operating system to drag and drop files onto and out of your device. \nThe following are the default mount options: Windows: mount -o nolock rsize=128 wsize=128 mtype=hard ipaddress:/buckets/BucketName * Linux: mount -t nfs ipaddress:/buckets/BucketName mount_point macOS: mount -t nfs -o vers=3,rsize=131072,wsize=131072,nolocks,hard,retrans=2 ipaddress:/buckets/$bucketname mount_point\nChoose the icon next to the drive letter to open the file share in your client's file browser. Then start transferring files from your client to your Snow Family device. You can copy and paste, or drag and drop files from your client computer into the file share. In Windows, your file share looks like the following: buckets(\\\\12.123.45.679)(Z:)",

The auto-extract feature supports the TAR, ZIP, and tar.gz formats.\n\nIdentify which small files you want to batch together, including their size and the total number of files that you want to batch together.\n\nBatch your files on the command line as shown in the following examples.\n\nFor Linux, you can batch the files in the same command line used to transfer your files to the device. \ntar -cf - /Logs/April | aws s3 cp - s3://mybucket/batch01.tar --metadata snowball-auto-extract=true --endpoint http://192.0.2.0:8080\nNoteAlternatively, you can use the archive utility of your choice to batch the files into one or more large archives. However, this approach requires extra local storage to save the archives before you transfer them to the Snowball.For Windows, use the following example command:\n7z a -tzip -so \"test\" | aws s3 cp - s3://mybucket/batch01.zip --metadata snowball-auto-extract=true --endpoint http://192.0.2.0:8080\nNoteFor Microsoft Windows 2016, tar is not available, but you can download it from the Tar for Windows website.You can download 7 ZIP from the 7ZIP website. Repeat until you've archived all the small files that you want to transfer to Amazon S3 using a Snowball Edge.\n\nTransfer the archived files to the Snowball. If you want the data to be auto-extracted, and you used one of the supported archive formats mentioned previously in step 1, use the AWS CLI cp command with the --metadata snowball-auto-extract=true option.\nNoteIf there are non-archive files, don't use this command.",

"text": "The maximum size of a file that you can transfer to the file interface on a Snowball Edge device is 5 TB. We recommend that you use only one method at a time of reading and writing data to each bucket on a Snowball Edge device. Using both the file interface and the Amazon S3 interface on the same bucket might result in undefined behavior.\n\nThe file interface supports all NFS file operations, except truncate, rename, or changing ownership. Requests that use these unsupported file operations are rejected with error messages sent to your NFS client. Attempts to change a file's permissions after the file has been created on the Snowball Edge device are ignored without error.\n\nIf the Snowball Edge device has a power failure or is rebooted, data in the file interface buffer persists. On reboot, this buffered data is uploaded to buckets on the device. When Write status on the File interface tab shows 100 percent with a green progress bar, all data in the file interface buffer is uploaded to the buckets on the device.\n\nDon't write data to a Snowball Edge device that is full, or write more data than the size of the remaining available storage. Either action causes errors that might corrupt your data. Before writing data, we recommend that you determine the remaining amount of space on the Snowball Edge device. Then compare that to the amount of data you want to copy over using the file interface before copying the data.\n\nWhen you've finished copying data to the Snowball Edge device using the file interface, you must disable the file interface to avoid losing any data that might be in the buffer but not yet written to the Amazon S3 bucket. For more information, see Disabling the File Interface.\n\nWe recommend that you keep a local copy of all data that is written to the file interface until the Snowball Edge device has been shipped back to AWS and the data has been ingested to Amazon S3.",

"text": "After you order, receive, and deploy your Snowball Edge device, you must create and activate your Tape Gateway from the same AWS Region. Attempting to create and activate the Tape Gateway in any AWS Region other than where the Snowball Edge was ordered is not supported, and will not work.\n\nTo back up your tape data using your Snowball Edge device with a Tape Gateway, connect the virtual tape devices on the gateway to a Windows or Linux client on your network, and then access them using your preferred backup software. For more information about connecting the gateway to a client and testing it with your backup software, see Using Your Tape Gateway in the AWS Storage Gateway User Guide.\n\nWhen a virtual tape is in the Available state in the Storage Gateway console, it is ready to be mounted using your preferred backup software, and its full capacity is reserved in physical storage on the Snowball Edge device. When you eject a virtual tape, its status changes from Available to In transit to VTS, and only the specific amount of data written to the tape remains reserved on the Snowball Edge device. You don't need to eject virtual tapes from your backup software before shipping your Snowball Edge device back to AWS. Any virtual tapes left in the Available state are automatically ejected during the data-transfer process at the AWS facility.\n\nAfter you copy the data to your Snowball Edge device, you can schedule a pickup appointment to ship the device back to AWS. The E Ink shipping label is automatically updated to ensure that the device is sent to the correct AWS facility. For more information, see Shipping an AWS Snowball Edge.\nYou can track the device by using Amazon SNS generated text messages and emails.\n\nAfter your tape data is successfully transferred to the AWS Cloud and your Snowball Edge job is complete, you must manually delete the associated Tape Gateway using the Storage Gateway console.\n\nIn rare cases, data corruption or other technical difficulties might prevent AWS from transferring specific virtual tapes to the AWS Cloud after receiving your Snowball Edge device. In such a case, you must use the Storage Gateway console to delete the virtual tapes that failed to transfer before you can re-attempt the transfer on another Snowball Edge device.\n\nA Snowball Edge device with a Tape Gateway supports only importing virtual tape data to AWS, and cannot be used to access data that has already been imported. To access your imported tape data, set up a standard Tape Gateway hosted on a virtual machine, hardware appliance, or Amazon EC2 instance, and transfer the data from AWS over a network connection.\n\nA Snowball Edge device that is configured for a Tape Gateway is not intended for use with other Snowball Edge services or resources, such as Amazon S3, Network File System (NFS) file systems, AWS Lambda, or Amazon EC2. To use those services or resources, you must create a new Snowball Edge job to order a separate, appropriately configured device. For instructions, see Creating an AWS Snowball Edge Job.\n\nTo troubleshoot a Snowball Edge device with a Tape Gateway, or if directed to do so by AWS Support, you might need to connect to your gateway's local console. The local console is a configuration interface that runs on the Snowball Edge device that's hosting your gateway. You can use this local console to perform maintenance tasks specific to the gateway on that device. For more information, see Performing Maintenance Tasks on the Local Console in the AWS Storage Gateway User Guide.\nTo access the local console for the Tape Gateway running on your Snowball Edge device: From the command prompt on a computer connected to the same local network as your device, run the following command: \nssh user_name@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx\nTo run this command, replace user_name with your local console user name, and replace xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx with the Tape Gateway IP address that you obtained when you launched the Tape Gateway on your Snowball Edge device. For instructions on how to obtain the Tape Gateway IP address, see Deploying a Snowball Edge device with a Tape Gateway.\n\nEnter your password.\nNoteIf this is your first time logging in to the local console on this device, the default user name is admin, and the default password is password. Change the default password immediately after you log in. For more information, see Logging in to the Local Console Using Default Credentials in the AWS Storage Gateway User Guide.",

Within a Snowball Edge, there is an IoT device associated with the Amazon S3 interface. When data is written using Amazon S3 PUT object operations on buckets specified at job creation, these operations trigger MQTT messages. These messages in turn trigger any associated Lambda functions. In addition, any MQTT-compatible device or software in your AWS IoT Greengrass group can trigger the Lambda functions, if you define the related MQTT message to do so.\n\nAssociated service role \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Before you can use AWS IoT Greengrass with a Snowball Edge as a core device, you must associate an AWS IoT Greengrass service role with your account.

In the Amazon EC2 console, you do this in the Add storage step. For a list of the supported compute instance storage volumes and sizes on a Snowball Edge device, see Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud endpoints and quotas in the AWS General Reference.Install and configure the applications that you want to run on the Snowball Edge, and make sure that they work as expected.\nImportant\n\nOnly single volume AMIs are supported.\n\nThe EBS volume in your AMI should be 10 TB or less. We recommend that you provision the EBS volume size needed for the data in the AMI. This will help decrease the time it takes to export your AMI and load it into your device. You can resize or add more volumes to your instance after your device is deployed.\n\nThe EBS snapshot in your AMI must not be encrypted.\n\nMake a copy of the PEM or PPK file that you used for the SSH key pair when you created this instance. Save this file to the server that you plan to use to communicate with the Snowball Edge device. Make a note of the path to this file because you will need it when you use SSH to connect to the EC2 instance on your device.\nImportantIf you don't follow this procedure, you can't connect to your instances with SSH when you receive your Snowball Edge device.\nSave the instance as an AMI. For more information, see Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.Repeat steps 1\u00e2\u0080\u00934 for each of the instances that you want to connect to using SSH. Be sure to make copies of each of the SSH key pairs, and keep track of the AMIs that they're associated with.Now, when you order your device, these AMIs are available to add to your device.",

"text": "To put an SSH key into an AMI \nLaunch a new instance in the AWS Cloud based on the CentOS 7 (x86_64) - with Updates HVM, Ubuntu 16.04 LTS - Xenial (HVM), and Amazon Linux 2 AMI image, or Windows.\n\nWhen you launch your instance, make sure that the storage size that you assign to the instance is appropriate for your later use on the Snowball Edge. In the Amazon EC2 console, you do this in Step 4: Add Storage. For a list of the supported sizes for compute instance storage volumes on a Snowball Edge, see Quotas for Compute Instances on a Snowball Edge Device.\n\nInstall and configure the applications that you want to run on the Snowball Edge, and test that they work as expected.\n\nMake a copy of the PEM/PPK file that you used for the SSH key pair to create this instance. Save this file to the server that you plan to use to communicate with the Snowball Edge. This file is required for using SSH to connect to the launched instance on your device, so make a note of the path to this file.\n\nSave the instance as an AMI. For more information, see Creating an Amazon EBS-Backed Linux AMI in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.\n\nRepeat this procedure for each of the instances that you want to connect to using SSH. Make sure that you make copies of your different SSH key pairs and take note of the AMIs they're associated with.",

You will need the MAC address of the device for the next step.\ncreate-direct-network-interface [--endpoint endpoint] [--instance-id instanceId] [--mac macAddress] [--physical-network-interface-id physicalNetworkInterfaceId] [--unlock-code unlockCode] [--vlan vlanId]\n\nOPTIONS\n --endpoint <endpoint> The endpoint to send this request to. The endpoint for your devices will be a URL using the https scheme followed by an IP address. For example, if the IP address for your device is 123.0.1.2, the endpoint for your device would be https://123.0.1.2.\n --instance-id <instanceId> The EC2 instance ID to attach the interface to (optional).\n --mac <macAddress> Sets the MAC address of the network interface (optional).\n--physical-network-interface-id <physicalNetworkInterfaceId> The ID for the physical network interface on which to create a new virtual network interface. You can determine the physical network interfaces available on your Snowball Edge using the describe-device command.\n\n--vlan <vlanId> Set the assigned VLAN for the interface (optional). When specified, all traffic sent from the interface is tagged with the specified VLAN ID. Incoming traffic is filtered for the specified VLAN ID, and has all VLAN tags stripped before being passed to the instance.\n\nIf you didn't associate your DNI with an instance in step 1, you can associate it by running the Updating a Direct Network Interface command.\n\nAfter you create a DNI and associate it with your EC2 instance, you must make two configuration changes inside your Amazon EC2 instance. The first is to change ensure that packets meant for the VNI associated with the EC2 instance are sent through eth0. The second change configures your direct network interface to use either DCHP or static IP when booting. To set these configurations, you must first SSH into your EC2 instance and run a script to route packets that are meant for the VNI to eth0 and set your DNI to either DHCP or static IP. \nThe following is an example of a shell script for CentOS that makes these configuration changes.\n# Mac address of the direct network interface. You got this when you created the direct network interface.\nDNI_MAC=[MAC ADDRESS FROM CREATED DNI]\n# The name to use for the direct network interface. You can pick any name that isn't already in use.\nDNI=eth1\n\n# Configure routing so that packets meant for the VNIC always are sent through eth0 \nPRIVATE_IP=$(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/local-ipv4)\nPRIVATE_GATEWAY=$(ip route show to match 0/0 dev eth0 | awk '{print $3}')\nROUTE_TABLE=10001\necho from $PRIVATE_IP table $ROUTE_TABLE > /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/rule-eth0\necho default via $PRIVATE_GATEWAY dev eth0 table $ROUTE_TABLE > /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/route-eth0\n\n# Configure your direct network interface to use DHCP on boot.\ncat << EOF > /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-$DNI\nDEVICE=\"$DNI\"\nNAME=\"$DNI\"\nHWADDR=\"$DNI_MAC\"\nONBOOT=yes\nNOZEROCONF=yes\nBOOTPROTO=dhcp\nTYPE=Ethernet\nEOF\n\n# Rename DNI device if needed.\nCURRENT_DEVICE_NAME=$(LANG=C ip -o link | awk -F ': ' -vIGNORECASE=1 '!/link\\/ieee802\\.11/ && /'\"$DNI_MAC\"'/ { print $2 }')\nip link set $CURRENT_DEVICE_NAME name $DNI\n\n# Make all changes live.\nsystemctl restart network",

Boot volumes must be type sbg1.\nThe JSON syntax for this command is as follows.\n{ \"DeviceName\": \"/dev/sdh\", \"Ebs\": { \"DeleteOnTermination\": true|false, \"VolumeSize\": 100, \"VolumeType\": \"sbp1\"|\"sbg1\" }\n} --count \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Number of instances to launch. If a single number is provided, it is assumed to be the minimum to launch (defaults to 1). If a range is provided in the form min:max, then the first number is interpreted as the minimum number of instances to launch and the second is interpreted as the maximum number of instances to launch.\n\n--image-id \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The Snowball AMI ID of the AMI, which you can get by calling describe-images. An AMI is required to launch an instance.\n\n--InstanceInitiatedShutdownBehavior \u00e2\u0080\u0093 By default, when you initiate a shutdown from your instance (using a command such as shutdown or poweroff), the instance stops. You can change this behavior so that it terminates instead. The parameters stop and terminate are supported. The default is stop. For more information, see Changing the instance initiated shutdown behavior in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.\n\n--instance-type \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The sbe instance type.\n\n--launch-template structure \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The launch template to use to launch the instances. Any parameters that you specify in the run-instances command override the same parameters in the launch template. You can specify either the name or ID of a launch template, but not both.\n{ \"LaunchTemplateId\": \"string\", \"LaunchTemplateName\": \"string\", \"Version\": \"string\"\n} --security-group-ids \u00e2\u0080\u0093 One or more security group IDs. You can create a security group using CreateSecurityGroup. If no value is provided, the ID for the default security group is assigned to created instances.\n\n--tag-specifications \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The tags to apply to the resources during launch. You can only tag instances on launch. The specified tags are applied to all instances that are created during launch. To tag a resource after it has been created, use create-tags.\n\n--user-data \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The user data to make available to the instance. If you are using the AWS CLI, base64-encoding is performed for you, and you can load the text from a file. Otherwise, you must provide base64-encoded text.\n\n--key-name (string) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The name of the key pair. You can create a key pair using CreateKeyPair or ImportKeyPair. \nWarningIf you don't specify a key pair, you can't connect to the instance unless you choose an AMI that is configured to allow users another way to log in. start-instances \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Starts an sbe instance that you've previously stopped. All resources attached to the instance persist through starts and stops, but are erased if the instance is terminated. --instance-ids \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The IDs of one or more sbe instances that were stopped on the device. stop-instances \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Stops an sbe instance that is running. All resources attached to the instance persist through starts and stops, but are erased if the instance is terminated. --instance-ids \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The IDs of one or more sbe instances to be stopped on the device. terminate-instances \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Shuts down one or more instances. This operation is idempotent; if you terminate an instance more than once, each call succeeds. All resources attached to the instance persist through starts and stops, but data is erased if the instance is terminated.\nNoteBy default, when you use a command like shutdown or poweroff to initiate a shutdown from your instance, the instance stops. However, you can use the InstanceInitiatedShutdownBehavior attribute to change this behavior so that these commands terminate your instance. For more information, see Changing the instance initiated shutdown behavior in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances. --instance-ids \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The IDs of one or more sbe instances to be terminated on the device. All associated data stored for those instances will be lost. create-key-pair \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Creates a 2048-bit RSA key pair with the specified name. Amazon EC2 stores the public key and displays the private key for you to save to a file. The private key is returned as an unencrypted PEM-encoded PKCS#1 private key. If a key with the specified name already exists, Amazon EC2 returns an error. --key-name (string) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 A unique name for the key pair.\nConstraints: Up to 255 ASCII characters. [--tag-specifications] (list) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The tags to apply to the new key pair.\n\n{ \"ResourceType\": \"image\"|\"instance\"|\"key-pair\"|\"launch-template\"|\"security-group\", \"Tags\": [ { \"Key\": \"string\", \"Value\": \"string\" } ... ] } ...\n\nimport-key-pair \u00e2\u0080\u0093 --key-name (string) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 A unique name for the key pair.\nConstraints: Up to 255 ASCII characters. --public-key-material (blob) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The public key. For API calls, the text must be base64-encoded. For command line tools, base64-encoding is performed for you. [--tag-specifications] (list) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The tags to apply to the new key pair.\n\n{ \"ResourceType\": \"image\"|\"instance\"|\"key-pair\"|\"launch-template\"|\"security-group\", \"Tags\": [ { \"Key\": \"string\", \"Value\": \"string\" } ... ] }\n\ndescribe-key-pairs \u00e2\u0080\u0093 [--filters] (list) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The filters.\n\nkey-pair-id \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The ID of the key pair.\n\nkey-name \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The name of the key pair.\n\ntag-key \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value.\n\n[--tag-specifications] (list) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The tags to apply to the new key pair.\n\ntag :key \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key Owner and the value Team A, specify tag:Owner for the filter name and Team A for the filter value.\n\n{ \"Name\": \"string\", \"Values\": [\"string\", ...] } ...\n\n[--key-names] (list) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The key pair names.\nDefault: Describes all your key pairs.\n\n[--key-pair-ids] (list) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The IDs of the key pairs.\n\ndelete-key-pair \u00e2\u0080\u0093 [--key-name] (string) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The name of the key pair.\n\n[--key-pair-id] (string) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The ID of the key pair.",

If you use HDD-based block storage on AWS Snowball Edge, it reduces the amount of memory available for Amazon S3 objects. Likewise, Amazon S3 objects reduce the amount of memory available for Amazon EBS block storage on HDD volumes.\n\nAmazon EC2 root volumes always use the IDE driver. Additional Amazon EBS volumes will preferentially use the Virtio driver if available. If the Virtio driver isn't available, SBE defaults to the IDE driver. The Virtio driver allows for better performance and is recommended.\n\nWhen creating Amazon EBS volumes, the encrypted parameter isn't supported. However, all data on your device is encrypted by default. .\n\nVolumes can be from 1 GB to 10 TB in size.\n\nUp to 10 Amazon EBS volumes can be attached to a single EC2 instance.\n\nThere is no formal limit to the number of Amazon EBS volumes you can have on your AWS Snowball Edge device.

INSTALLED_AUTOSTART \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Snow Device Management is installed, and the device attempts to connect to its AWS Region when it is powered on. When you order a new Snow Family device through the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) or an AWS SDK, you use the --remote-management parameter to specify the INSTALLED_ONLY or INSTALLED_AUTOSTART states when running the create-job command. If you don't specify a value for this parameter, Snow Device Management defaults to INSTALLED_ONLY for supported devices.\nNoteIt is not possible to order a new Snow Family device without preinstalled Snow Device Management feature artifacts. The NOT_INSTALLED state exists only to identify devices that don't support the feature or that were already in the field before its launch. If you don't want to use Snow Device Management, set it to the INSTALLED_ONLY state.Snow Device Management can't be added to a Snow Family device that is already deployed in the field.

Clusters can withstand the loss of two nodes before the data is in danger. You can also add or replace nodes.\n\nIncreased storage \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The total available storage is 45 terabytes of data per node in the cluster. Thus, in a five-node cluster, there are 225 terabytes of available storage space. In contrast, there are about 80 terabytes of available storage space in a standalone Snowball Edge.

"text": "We recommend that you have a redundant power supply to reduce potential performance and stability issues for your cluster.\n\nAs with standalone local storage and compute jobs, the data stored in a cluster can't be imported into Amazon S3 without ordering additional devices as a part of separate import jobs. If you order these devices, you can transfer the data from the cluster to the devices and import the data when you return the devices for the import jobs.\n\nTo get data onto a cluster from Amazon S3, create a separate export job and copy the data from the devices of the export job onto the cluster.\n\nYou can create a cluster job from the console, the AWS CLI, or one of the AWS SDKs. For a guided walkthrough of creating a job, see Getting Started.\n\nCluster nodes have node IDs. A node ID is the same as the job ID for a device that you can get from the console, the AWS CLI, the AWS SDKs, and the Snowball Edge client. You can use node IDs to remove old nodes from clusters. You can get a list of node IDs by using the snowballEdge describe-device command on an unlocked device or the describe-cluster on an unlocked cluster.\n\nThe lifespan of a cluster is limited by the security certificate granted to the cluster devices when the cluster is provisioned. By default, Snowball Edge devices can be used for up to 360 days before they need to be returned. At the end of that time, the devices stop responding to read/write requests. If you need to keep one or more devices for longer than 360 days, contact AWS Support.\n\nWhen AWS receives a returned device that was part of a cluster, we perform a complete erasure of the device. This erasure follows the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 800-88 standards.",

"text": "Importing Jobs into Amazon S3 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The transfer of 80 TB or less of your local data copied onto a single device, and then moved into Amazon S3. For import jobs, Snowball devices and jobs have a one-to-one relationship. Each job has exactly one device associated with it. If you need to import more data, you can create new import jobs or clone existing ones. When you return a device of this job type, that data on it is imported into Amazon S3.\n\nExporting Jobs from Amazon S3 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The transfer of any amount of data (located in Amazon S3), copied onto any number of Snowball Edge devices, and then moved one AWS Snowball Edge device at a time into your on-premises data destination. When you create an export job, it's split into job parts. Each job part is no more than 80 TB in size, and each job part has exactly one AWS Snowball Edge device associated with it. When you return a device of this job type, it's erased.\n\nLocal Compute and Storage Only Jobs \u00e2\u0080\u0093 These jobs involve one AWS Snowball Edge device, or multiple devices used in a cluster. These jobs don't start with data in their buckets like an export job, and they can't have data imported into Amazon S3 at the end like an import job. When you return a device of this job type, it's erased. With this job type, you also have the option of creating a cluster of devices. A cluster improves local storage durability and you can scale up or down with local storage capacity.\nIn Regions where Lambda is not available, this job type is called Local storage only.",

Instead, contact AWS Support, and a new AWS Snowball Edge device will be shipped to you.\n\nWe recommend that you don't save a copy of the unlock code in the same location on the workstation as the manifest for that job. Saving these in different locations helps prevent unauthorized parties from gaining access to the AWS Snowball Edge device. For example, you can save a copy of the manifest to your local server, and email the code to a user that unlocks the device. This approach limits access to the AWS Snowball Edge device to individuals who have access to files saved on the server and the user's email address.\n\nThe credentials displayed, when you run the Snowball Edge client commands list-access-keys and get-secret-access-key, are a pair of access keys used to access your device.\nThese keys are only associated with the job and the local resources on the device. They don't map to your AWS account or any other AWS account. If you try to use these keys to access services and resources in the AWS Cloud, they will fail because they only work for the local resources associated with your job.",

"text": "AWS account root user \u00e2\u0080\u0093 When you first create an AWS account, you begin with a single sign-in identity that has complete access to all AWS services and resources in the account. This identity is called the AWS account root user and is accessed by signing in with the email address and password that you used to create the account. We strongly recommend that you do not use the root user for your everyday tasks, even the administrative ones. Instead, adhere to the best practice of using the root user only to create your first IAM user. Then securely lock away the root user credentials and use them to perform only a few account and service management tasks. IAM user \u00e2\u0080\u0093 An IAM user is an identity within your AWS account that has specific custom permissions (for example, permissions to create a job in AWS Snowball). You can use an IAM user name and password to sign in to secure AWS webpages like the AWS Management Console, AWS Discussion Forums, or the AWS Support Center.\nIn addition to a user name and password, you can also generate access keys for each user. You can use these keys when you access AWS services programmatically, either through one of the several SDKs or by using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI). The SDK and CLI tools use the access keys to cryptographically sign your request. If you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t use AWS tools, you must sign the request yourself. AWS Snowball supports Signature Version 4, a protocol for authenticating inbound API requests. For more information about authenticating requests, see Signature Version 4 signing process in the AWS General Reference.\n\nIAM role \u00e2\u0080\u0093 An IAM role is an IAM identity that you can create in your account that has specific permissions. An IAM role is similar to an IAM user in that it is an AWS identity with permissions policies that determine what the identity can and cannot do in AWS. However, instead of being uniquely associated with one person, a role is intended to be assumable by anyone who needs it. Also, a role does not have standard long-term credentials such as a password or access keys associated with it. Instead, when you assume a role, it provides you with temporary security credentials for your role session. IAM roles with temporary credentials are useful in the following situations: Federated user access \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Instead of creating an IAM user, you can use existing identities from AWS Directory Service, your enterprise user directory, or a web identity provider. These are known as federated users. AWS assigns a role to a federated user when access is requested through an identity provider. For more information about federated users, see Federated users and roles in the IAM User Guide. AWS service access \u00e2\u0080\u0093 A service role is an IAM role that a service assumes to perform actions on your behalf. An IAM administrator can create, modify, and delete a service role from within IAM. For more information, see Creating a role to delegate permissions to an AWS service in the IAM User Guide. Applications running on Amazon EC2 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 You can use an IAM role to manage temporary credentials for applications that are running on an EC2 instance and making AWS CLI or AWS API requests. This is preferable to storing access keys within the EC2 instance. To assign an AWS role to an EC2 instance and make it available to all of its applications, you create an instance profile that is attached to the instance. An instance profile contains the role and enables programs that are running on the EC2 instance to get temporary credentials. For more information, see Using an IAM role to grant permissions to applications running on Amazon EC2 instances in the IAM User Guide.",

"text": "For security purposes, jobs using an AWS Snowball Edge device must be completed within 360 days of being prepared. If you need to keep one or more devices for longer than 360 days, contact AWS Support. Otherwise, after 360 days, the device becomes locked, can no longer be accessed, and must be returned. If the AWS Snowball Edge device becomes locked during an import job, we can still transfer the existing data on the device into Amazon S3.\n\nCurrently, the AWS Snowball Edge device doesn't support server-side encryption with customer-provided keys (SSE-C). AWS Snowball Edge does support server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3) and server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service managed keys (SSE-KMS). For more information, see Protecting data using server-side encryption in the Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide.\n\nIf you're using an AWS Snowball Edge device to import data, and you need to transfer more data than will fit on a single Snowball Edge device, create additional jobs. Each export job can use multiple Snowball Edge devices.\n\nThe default service limit for the number of Snowball Edge devices you can have at one time is 1. If you want to increase your service limit or create a cluster job, contact AWS Support.\n\nMetadata for objects transferred to a device is not persisted, unless it's transferred with the file interface. The only metadata that remains the same is filename and filesize. All other metadata is set as in the following example: \n-rw-rw-r-- 1 root root [filesize] Dec 31 1969 [path/filename]",

If the ping returns no connect, confirm the IP address for the device and confirm your local network configuration.\n\nIf the IP address is correct and the lights on the back of the device are flashing, use telnet to test the device on ports 22, 9091, and 8080. Testing port 22 determines whether the Snowball Edge is working correctly. Testing port 9091 determines whether the AWS CLI can be used to send commands to the device. Testing port 8080 helps ensure that the device can write to the Amazon S3 buckets on it. If you can connect on port 22 but not on port 8080, first power off the Snowball Edge and then unplug all the cables. Leave the device for 10 minutes, and then reconnect it and start again.",

The top-level subdirectories have the names of the Amazon S3 buckets that you included in the job. Put your data in those subdirectories.\n\nIf you're using Linux and you can't upload files with UTF-8 characters to an AWS Snowball Edge device, it might be because your Linux server doesn't recognize UTF-8 character encoding. You can correct this issue by installing the locales package on your Linux server and configuring it to use one of the UTF-8 locales like en_US.UTF-8. You can configure the locales package by exporting the environment variable LC_ALL, for example: export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8\n\nWhen you use the Amazon S3 interface with the AWS CLI, you can work with files or folders with spaces in their names, such as my photo.jpg or My Documents. However, make sure that you handle the spaces properly. For more information, see Specifying parameter values for the AWS CLI in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.",

"text": "The maximum size of a file that you can transfer to the file interface on a Snowball Edge is 150 GB. If you try to transfer a file larger than 150 GB, the file interface writes the first 150 GB of that file, and then returns an error message indicating that the file is too large.\n\nWe recommend that you use only one method at a time of reading and writing data to each bucket on a Snowball Edge device. Using both the file interface and the Amazon S3 interface on the same bucket might result in undefined behavior.\n\nThe file interface supports all NFS file operations, except truncation, renaming, and changing ownership. Requests that use these unsupported file operations are rejected with error messages sent to your NFS client. Attempts to change a file's permissions after the file has been created on the Snowball Edge are ignored without an error message.\n\nIf the Snowball Edge has a power failure or is rebooted, data in the file interface buffer persists. On reboot, this buffered data is uploaded to buckets on the device. When Write status on the File interface tab shows 100 percent with a green progress bar, all data in the file interface buffer is uploaded to the buckets on the device.\n\nDon't write data to a Snowball Edge that is full. Also don't write more data to a Snowball Edge than can fit in the remaining available storage. Either action causes errors that might corrupt your data. We recommend that you use the Snowball Edge client's snowballEdge describe-device command to determine the remaining amount of space on the Snowball Edge. Then compare the remaining space to the amount of data that you want to copy using the file interface before copying the data.\n\nWhen you've finished copying data to the Snowball Edge using the file interface, you must disable the file interface. You do so to avoid losing any data that might be in the buffer but not yet written to the Amazon S3 bucket. For more information, see Disabling the File Interface.\n\nWe recommend that you keep a local copy of all data that is written to the file interface until the Snowball Edge has been shipped back to AWS and the data has been ingested to Amazon S3.",

A Snowball Edge device with a Tape Gateway lets you to migrate petabytes of data stored on physical tapes to AWS without changing your existing tape-based backup workflows, and without extreme network infrastructure or bandwidth-usage requirements. A standard Tape Gateway temporarily stores your tape data in the gateway cache and uses your network connection to transfer the data asynchronously to the AWS Cloud. However, a Snowball Edge device with a Tape Gateway stores your tape data on the device itself until you return it to AWS, and uses your network connection only for device-management traffic.",

AWS then stores your tape data in secure, durable, and low-cost Amazon S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage. With this combination of technologies, you can migrate your tape data to AWS in situations where you have network-connectivity limitations, bandwidth constraints, or high connection costs.
