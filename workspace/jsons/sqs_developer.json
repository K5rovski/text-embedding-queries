Standard queues support at-least-once message delivery, and FIFO queues support exactly-once message processing.\n\nAvailability \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Amazon SQS uses redundant infrastructure to provide highly-concurrent access to messages and high availability for producing and consuming messages. Scalability \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Amazon SQS can process each buffered request independently, scaling transparently to handle any load increases or spikes without any provisioning instructions.\n\nReliability \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Amazon SQS locks your messages during processing, so that multiple producers can send and multiple consumers can receive messages at the same time. Customization \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Your queues don't have to be exactly alike\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example, you can set a default delay on a queue. You can store the contents of messages larger than 256 KB using Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) or Amazon DynamoDB, with Amazon SQS holding a pointer to the Amazon S3 object, or you can split a large message into smaller messages.",

Then select Custom password, and then enter your new password in the text box.\n\n(Optional) By default, AWS requires the new user to create a new password when first signing in. You can clear the check box next to User must create a new password at next sign-in to allow the new user to reset their password after they sign in.\n\nChoose Next: Permissions.\n\nUnder Set permissions, choose Add user to group.\n\nChoose Create group.\n\nIn the Create group dialog box, for Group name enter Administrators.\n\nChoose Filter policies, and then select AWS managed - job function to filter the table contents.\n\nIn the policy list, select the check box for AdministratorAccess. Then choose Create group.\nNoteYou must activate IAM user and role access to Billing before you can use the AdministratorAccess permissions to access the AWS Billing and Cost Management console. To do this, follow the instructions in step 1 of the tutorial about delegating access to the billing console.\n\nBack in the list of groups, select the check box for your new group. Choose Refresh if necessary to see the group in the list.\n\nChoose Next: Tags.\n\n(Optional) Add metadata to the user by attaching tags as key-value pairs.

"text": "To create an Amazon SQS queue (console)Open the Amazon SQS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/sqs/.\nChoose Create queue.\n\nFor Type, the Standard queue type is set by default. To create a FIFO queue, choose FIFO.\nNoteYou can't change the queue type after you create the queue. Enter a Name for your queue. The name of a FIFO queue must end with the .fifo suffix.\n\n(Optional) The console sets default values for the queue configuration parameters. Under Configuration, you can set new values for the following parameters:\n\nFor Visibility timeout , enter the duration and units. The range is from 0 seconds to 12 hours. The default value is 30 seconds.\n\nFor Message retention period, enter the duration and units. The range is from 1 minute to 14 days. The default value is 4 days.\n\nFor Delivery delay, enter the duration and units. The range is from 0 seconds to 15 minutes. The default value is 0 seconds.\n\nFor Maximum message size, enter a value. The range is from 1 KB to 256 KB. The default value is 256 KB. For Receive message wait time, enter a value. The range is from 0 to 20 seconds. The default value is 0 seconds, which sets short polling. Any non-zero value sets long polling.\n\nFor a FIFO queue, choose Enable content-based deduplication to enable content-based deduplication. The default setting is disabled. \n(Optional) For a FIFO queue, to enable higher throughput for sending and receiving messages in the queue, \nchoose Enable high throughput FIFO.\nChoosing this option changes the related options (Deduplication scope and FIFO throughput limit) \nto the required settings for enabling high throughput for FIFO queues. If you change any of the settings required for using high throughput FIFO, normal\nthroughput is in effect for the queue, and deduplication occurs as specified. For more information, see \nHigh throughput for FIFO queues and \nQuotas related to messages.\nFor Redrive allow policy, choose Allow all (the default), By queue or Deny all. When choosing By queue,  specify a list of up to 10 source queues by the Amazon Resource Name (ARN). (Optional) Define an Access policy. The access policy defines the accounts, users, and roles that can access the queue. The access policy also defines the actions (such as SendMessage, ReceiveMessage, or DeleteMessage) that the users can access. The default policy allows only the queue owner to send and receive messages.\nTo define the access policy, do one of the following: Choose Basic to configure who can send messages to the queue and who can receive messages from the queue. The console creates the policy based on your choices and displays the resulting access policy in the read-only JSON panel.\n\nChoose Advanced to modify the JSON access policy directly. This allows you to specify a custom set of actions that each principal (account, user, or role) can perform. (Optional) To configure encryption for the queue, expand Encryption.\n\n(Optional) To configure a dead-letter queue to receive undeliverable messages, expand Dead-letter queue.\n\n(Optional) To add tags to the queue, expand Tags.\n\nChoose Create queue. Amazon SQS creates the queue and displays the queue's Details page.",

"text": "Sending messages\n\nIf multiple messages are sent in succession to a FIFO queue, each with a distinct message deduplication ID, Amazon SQS stores the messages and acknowledges the transmission. Then, each message can be received and processed in the exact order in which the messages were transmitted.\nIn FIFO queues, messages are ordered based on message group ID. If multiple hosts (or different threads on the same host) send messages with the same message group ID to a FIFO queue, Amazon SQS stores the messages in the order in which they arrive for processing. To make sure that Amazon SQS preserves the order in which messages are sent and received, each producer should use a unique message group ID to send all its messages.\nFIFO queue logic applies only per message group ID. Each message group ID represents a distinct ordered message group within an Amazon SQS queue. For each message group ID, all messages are sent and received in strict order. However, messages with different message group ID values might be sent and received out of order. You must associate a message group ID with a message. If you don't provide a message group ID, the action fails. If you require a single group of ordered messages, provide the same message group ID for messages sent to the FIFO queue.\n\nReceiving messages\n\nYou can't request to receive messages with a specific message group ID.\nWhen receiving messages from a FIFO queue with multiple message group IDs, Amazon SQS first attempts to return as many messages with the same message group ID as possible. This allows other consumers to process messages with a different message group ID. When you receive a message with a message group ID, no more messages for the same message group ID are returned unless you delete the message or it becomes visible.\nNoteIt is possible to receive up to 10 messages in a single call using the MaxNumberOfMessages request parameter of the ReceiveMessage action. These messages retain their FIFO order and can have the same message group ID. Thus, if there are fewer than 10 messages available with the same message group ID, you might receive messages from another message group ID, in the same batch of 10 messages, but still in FIFO order.\n\nRetrying multiple times\nFIFO queues allow the producer or consumer to attempt multiple retries: If the producer detects a failed SendMessage action, it can retry sending as many times as necessary, using the same message deduplication ID. Assuming that the producer receives at least one acknowledgement before the deduplication interval expires, multiple retries neither affect the ordering of messages nor introduce duplicates.\n\nIf the consumer detects a failed ReceiveMessage action, it can retry as many times as necessary, using the same receive request attempt ID. Assuming that the consumer receives at least one acknowledgement before the visibility timeout expires, multiple retries don't affect the ordering of messages.\n\nWhen you receive a message with a message group ID, no more messages for the same message group ID are returned unless you delete the message or it becomes visible.",

The 3000 messages per second represent 300 API calls, each with a batch of 10 messages. To request a quota increase, submit a support request. Without batching, FIFO queues support up to 300 API calls per second, per API method (SendMessage, ReceiveMessage, or DeleteMessage). FIFO queues don't support per-message delays, only per-queue delays. If your application sets the same value of the DelaySeconds parameter on each message, you must modify your application to remove the per-message delay and set DelaySeconds on the entire queue instead.\n\nEvery message sent to a FIFO queue requires a message group ID. If you don't need multiple ordered message groups, specify the same message group ID for all your messages.\n\nBefore sending messages to a FIFO queue, confirm the following: If your application can send messages with identical message bodies, you can modify your application to provide a unique message deduplication ID for each sent message.\n\nIf your application sends messages with unique message bodies, you can enable content-based deduplication. You don't have to make any code changes to your consumer. However, if it takes a long time to process messages and your visibility timeout is set to a high value, consider adding a receive request attempt ID to each ReceiveMessage action.

For more information, see Configuring the Visibility Timeout.\n\nIf you don't know how long it takes to process a message, create a heartbeat for your consumer process: Specify the initial visibility timeout (for example, 2 minutes) and then\u00e2\u0080\u0094as long as your consumer still works on the message\u00e2\u0080\u0094keep extending the visibility timeout by 2 minutes every minute.  ImportantThe maximum visibility timeout is 12 hours from the time that Amazon SQS receives the ReceiveMessage request. Extending the visibility timeout does not reset the 12 hour maximum.Additionally, you may be unable to set the timeout on an individual message to the full 12 hours (e.g. 43,200 seconds) since the ReceiveMessage request initiates the timer. For example, if you receive a message and immediately set the 12 hour maximum by sending a ChangeMessageVisibility call with VisibilityTimeout equal to 43,200 seconds, it will likely fail. However, using a value of 43,195 seconds will work unless there is a significant delay between requesting the message via ReceiveMessage and updating the visibility timeout. If your consumer needs longer than 12 hours, consider using Step Functions.",

Using a single thread for each queue allows your application to process the messages in each of the queues as they become available, while using a single thread for polling multiple queues might cause your application to become unable to process messages available in other queues while the application waits (up to 20 seconds) for the queue which doesn't have any available messages.",

Both methods let you perform administrative operations not included in the JMS specification, such as creating new queues. However, the getWrappedAmazonSQSClient method also provides a wrapped version of the Amazon SQS client used by the current connection. The wrapper transforms every exception from the client into an JMSException, allowing it to be more easily used by existing code that expects JMSException occurrences.\n\nYou can use the client objects returned from getAmazonSQSClient and getWrappedAmazonSQSClient to perform administrative operations not included in the JMS specification (for example, you can create an Amazon SQS queue).\n If you have existing code that expects JMS exceptions, then you should use getWrappedAmazonSQSClient: If you use getWrappedAmazonSQSClient, the returned client object transforms all exceptions into JMS exceptions.\n\nIf you use getAmazonSQSClient, the exceptions are all Amazon SQS exceptions.",

Message attributes\nA message can contain up to 10 metadata attributes. Message batch\n\nA single message batch request can include a maximum of 10 messages. For more information, see Configuring AmazonSQSBufferedAsyncClient in the Amazon SQS batch actions section. Message content\n\nA message can include only XML, JSON, and unformatted text. The following Unicode characters are allowed: #x9 | #xA | #xD | #x20 to #xD7FF | #xE000 to #xFFFD | #x10000 to #x10FFFF\nAny characters not included in this list are rejected.

"text": "Data key\n\nThe data encryption key (DEK) responsible for encrypting the contents of Amazon SQS messages.\nFor more information, see Data Keys in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide in the AWS Encryption SDK Developer Guide.\n\nData key reuse period\n\nThe length of time, in seconds, for which Amazon SQS can reuse a data key to encrypt or decrypt messages before calling AWS KMS again. An integer representing seconds, between 60 seconds (1 minute) and 86,400 seconds (24 hours). The default is 300 (5 minutes). For more information, see Understanding the data key reuse period.\nNoteIn the unlikely event of being unable to reach AWS KMS, Amazon SQS continues to use the cached data key until a connection is reestablished.\n\nKMS key ID\n\nThe alias, alias ARN, key ID, or key ARN of an AWS managed KMS key or a custom KMS key\u00e2\u0080\u0094in your account or in another account. While the alias of the AWS managed KMS key for Amazon SQS is always alias/aws/sqs, the alias of a custom KMS key can, for example, be alias/MyAlias. You can use these KMS keys to protect the messages in Amazon SQS queues. \nNoteKeep the following in mind:\nIf you don't specify a custom KMS key, Amazon SQS uses the AWS managed KMS key for Amazon SQS.The first time you use the AWS Management Console to specify the AWS managed KMS key for Amazon SQS for a queue, AWS KMS creates the AWS managed KMS key for Amazon SQS.Alternatively, the first time you use the SendMessage or SendMessageBatch action on a queue with SSE enabled, AWS KMS creates the AWS managed KMS key for Amazon SQS.\nYou can create KMS keys, define the policies that control how KMS keys can be used, and audit KMS key usage using the Customer managed keys section of the AWS KMS console or the CreateKey AWS KMS action. For more information, see KMS keys and Creating Keys in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide. For more examples of KMS key identifiers, see KeyId in the AWS Key Management Service API Reference. For information about finding KMS key identifiers, see Find the Key ID and ARN in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.\nImportantThere are additional charges for using AWS KMS. For more information, see Estimating AWS KMS costs and AWS Key Management Service Pricing.\n\nEnvelope Encryption\n\nThe security of your encrypted data depends in part on protecting the data key that can decrypt it. Amazon SQS uses the KMS key to encrypt the data key and then the encrypted data key is stored with the encrypted message. This practice of using a KMS key to encrypt data keys is known as envelope encryption. \nFor more information, see Envelope Encryption in the AWS Encryption SDK Developer Guide.",

"text": "AWS account root user \u00e2\u0080\u0093 When you first create an AWS account, you begin with a single sign-in identity that has complete access to all AWS services and resources in the account. This identity is called the AWS account root user and is accessed by signing in with the email address and password that you used to create the account. We strongly recommend that you do not use the root user for your everyday tasks, even the administrative ones. Instead, adhere to the best practice of using the root user only to create your first IAM user. Then securely lock away the root user credentials and use them to perform only a few account and service management tasks. IAM user \u00e2\u0080\u0093 An IAM user is an identity within your AWS account that has specific custom permissions (for example, permissions to create a queue in Amazon SQS). You can use an IAM user name and password to sign in to secure AWS webpages like the AWS Management Console, AWS Discussion Forums, or the AWS Support Center.\nIn addition to a user name and password, you can also generate access keys for each user. You can use these keys when you access AWS services programmatically, either through one of the several SDKs or by using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI). The SDK and CLI tools use the access keys to cryptographically sign your request. If you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t use AWS tools, you must sign the request yourself. Amazon SQS supports Signature Version 4, a protocol for authenticating inbound API requests. For more information about authenticating requests, see Signature Version 4 signing process in the AWS General Reference.\n\nIAM role \u00e2\u0080\u0093 An IAM role is an IAM identity that you can create in your account that has specific permissions. An IAM role is similar to an IAM user in that it is an AWS identity with permissions policies that determine what the identity can and cannot do in AWS. However, instead of being uniquely associated with one person, a role is intended to be assumable by anyone who needs it. Also, a role does not have standard long-term credentials such as a password or access keys associated with it. Instead, when you assume a role, it provides you with temporary security credentials for your role session. IAM roles with temporary credentials are useful in the following situations: Federated user access \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Instead of creating an IAM user, you can use existing identities from AWS Directory Service, your enterprise user directory, or a web identity provider. These are known as federated users. AWS assigns a role to a federated user when access is requested through an identity provider. For more information about federated users, see Federated users and roles in the IAM User Guide. AWS service access \u00e2\u0080\u0093 A service role is an IAM role that a service assumes to perform actions on your behalf. An IAM administrator can create, modify, and delete a service role from within IAM. For more information, see Creating a role to delegate permissions to an AWS service in the IAM User Guide. Applications running on Amazon EC2 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 You can use an IAM role to manage temporary credentials for applications that are running on an EC2 instance and making AWS CLI or AWS API requests. This is preferable to storing access keys within the EC2 instance. To assign an AWS role to an EC2 instance and make it available to all of its applications, you create an instance profile that is attached to the instance. An instance profile contains the role and enables programs that are running on the EC2 instance to get temporary credentials. For more information, see Using an IAM role to grant permissions to applications running on Amazon EC2 instances in the IAM User Guide.",

"text": "In the first example, Bob has both an IAM policy and an Amazon SQS policy that apply to his account. The IAM policy grants his account permission for the ReceiveMessage action on queue_xyz, whereas the Amazon SQS policy gives his account permission for the SendMessage action on the same queue. The following diagram illustrates the concept. If Bob sends a ReceiveMessage request to queue_xyz, the IAM policy allows the action. If Bob sends a SendMessage request to queue_xyz, the Amazon SQS policy allows the action.\n\nIn the second example, Bob abuses his access to queue_xyz, so it becomes necessary to remove his entire access to the queue. The easiest thing to do is to add a policy that denies him access to all actions for the queue. This policy overrides the other two because an explicit deny always overrides an allow. For more information about policy evaluation logic, see Using custom policies with the Amazon SQS Access Policy Language. The following diagram illustrates the concept. You can also add an additional statement to the Amazon SQS policy that denies Bob any type of access to the queue. It has the same effect as adding an IAM policy that denies Bob access to the queue. For examples of policies that cover Amazon SQS actions and resources, see Basic examples of Amazon SQS policies. For more information about writing Amazon SQS policies, see Using custom policies with the Amazon SQS Access Policy Language.",

There can be three possible results at policy evaluation time: Default-deny, Allow, and Explicit-deny.\n\nExplicit-deny\n\nThe result of a Statement that has Effect set to deny.\n\nEvaluation\n\nThe process that Amazon SQS uses to determine whether an incoming request should be denied or allowed based on a Policy.\n\nIssuer\n\nThe user who writes a Policy to grant permissions to a resource. The issuer, by definition is always the resource owner. AWS doesn't permit Amazon SQS users to create policies for resources they don't own.\n\nKey\n\nThe specific characteristic that is the basis for access restriction.\n\nPermission\n\nThe concept of allowing or disallowing access to a resource using a Condition and a Key.\n\nPolicy\n\nThe document that acts as a container for one or more statements.
