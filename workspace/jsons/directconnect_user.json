Virtual interface name\nA name for the virtual interface. Virtual interface owner\nIf you're creating the virtual interface for another account, you need the AWS account ID of the other account. (Private virtual interface only) Connection\nFor connecting to a VPC in the same AWS Region, you need the virtual private gateway for your VPC. The ASN for the Amazon side of the BGP session is inherited from the virtual private gateway. When you create a virtual private gateway, you can specify your own private ASN. Otherwise, Amazon provides a default ASN. For more information, see Create a Virtual Private Gateway in the Amazon VPC User Guide. For connecting to a VPC through a Direct Connect gateway, you need the Direct Connect gateway. For more information, see Direct Connect Gateways. VLAN\nA unique virtual local area network (VLAN) tag that's not already in use on your connection. The value must be between 1 and 4094 and must comply with the Ethernet 802.1Q standard. This tag is required for any traffic traversing the AWS Direct Connect connection. If you have a hosted connection, your AWS Direct Connect Partner provides this value. You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t modify the value after you have created the virtual interface. Peer IP addresses\n A virtual interface can support a BGP peering session for IPv4, IPv6, or one of each (dual-stack). Do not use Elastic IPs (EIPs) from the Amazon Pool to create a public virtual interface. You cannot create multiple BGP sessions for the same IP addressing family on the same virtual interface. The IP address ranges are assigned to each end of the virtual interface for the BGP peering session. IPv4: (Public virtual interface only) You must specify unique public IPv4 addresses that you own. The value can be one of the following:\n\nA customer-owned IPv4 CIDRAn IP range owned by your AWS Direct Connect Partner or ISP, along with an LOA-CFA authorization\nAn AWS-provided /31 CIDR. Contact AWS Support to request a public IPv4 CIDR (and provide a use case in your request)NoteWe cannot guarantee that we will be able to fulfill all requests for AWS-provided public IPv4 addresses. (Private virtual interface only) Amazon can generate private IPv4 addresses for you. If you specify your own, ensure that you specify private CIDRs for your router interface and the AWS Direct Connect interface only (for example, do not specify other IP addresses from your local network). IPv6: Amazon automatically allocates you a /125 IPv6 CIDR. You cannot specify your own peer IPv6 addresses. Address family\nWhether the BGP peering session will be over IPv4 or IPv6. BGP information A public or private Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Autonomous System Number (ASN) for your side of the BGP session. If you are using a public ASN, you must own it. If you are using a private ASN, you can set a custom ASN value. For a 16-bit ASN, the value must be in the 64512 to 65534 range.

(Private virtual interface only) Jumbo frames\nThe maximum transmission unit (MTU) of packets over AWS Direct Connect. The default is 1500. Setting the MTU of a virtual interface to 9001 (jumbo frames) can cause an update to the underlying physical connection if it wasn't updated to support jumbo frames. Updating the connection disrupts network connectivity for all virtual interfaces associated with the connection for up to 30 seconds. Jumbo frames apply only to propagated routes from AWS Direct Connect. If you add static routes to a route table that point to your virtual private gateway, then traffic routed through the static routes is sent using 1500 MTU. To check whether a connection or virtual interface supports jumbo frames, select it in the AWS Direct Connect console and find Jumbo frame capable on the virtual interface General configuration page. (Transit virtual interface only) Jumbo frames\nThe maximum transmission unit (MTU) of packets over AWS Direct Connect. The default is 1500. Setting the MTU of a virtual interface to 8500 (jumbo frames) can cause an update to the underlying physical connection if it wasn't updated to support jumbo frames. Updating the connection disrupts network connectivity for all virtual interfaces associated with the connection for up to 30 seconds. Jumbo frames are supported up to 8500 MTU for Direct Connect. Static routes and propagated routes configured in the Transit Gateway Route Table will support Jumbo Frames, including from EC2 instances with VPC static route table entries to the Transit Gateway Attachment.

Virtual interface name\nA name for the virtual interface. Virtual interface owner\nIf you're creating the virtual interface for another account, you need the AWS account ID of the other account. (Private virtual interface only) Connection\nFor connecting to a VPC in the same AWS Region, you need the virtual private gateway for your VPC. The ASN for the Amazon side of the BGP session is inherited from the virtual private gateway. When you create a virtual private gateway, you can specify your own private ASN. Otherwise, Amazon provides a default ASN. For more information, see Create a Virtual Private Gateway in the Amazon VPC User Guide. For connecting to a VPC through a Direct Connect gateway, you need the Direct Connect gateway. For more information, see Direct Connect Gateways. VLAN\nA unique virtual local area network (VLAN) tag that's not already in use on your connection. The value must be between 1 and 4094 and must comply with the Ethernet 802.1Q standard. This tag is required for any traffic traversing the AWS Direct Connect connection. If you have a hosted connection, your AWS Direct Connect Partner provides this value. You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t modify the value after you have created the virtual interface. Peer IP addresses\n A virtual interface can support a BGP peering session for IPv4, IPv6, or one of each (dual-stack). Do not use Elastic IPs (EIPs) from the Amazon Pool to create a public virtual interface. You cannot create multiple BGP sessions for the same IP addressing family on the same virtual interface. The IP address ranges are assigned to each end of the virtual interface for the BGP peering session. IPv4: (Public virtual interface only) You must specify unique public IPv4 addresses that you own. The value can be one of the following:\n\nA customer-owned IPv4 CIDRAn IP range owned by your AWS Direct Connect Partner or ISP, along with an LOA-CFA authorization\nAn AWS-provided /31 CIDR. Contact AWS Support to request a public IPv4 CIDR (and provide a use case in your request)NoteWe cannot guarantee that we will be able to fulfill all requests for AWS-provided public IPv4 addresses. (Private virtual interface only) Amazon can generate private IPv4 addresses for you. If you specify your own, ensure that you specify private CIDRs for your router interface and the AWS Direct Connect interface only (for example, do not specify other IP addresses from your local network). IPv6: Amazon automatically allocates you a /125 IPv6 CIDR. You cannot specify your own peer IPv6 addresses. Address family\nWhether the BGP peering session will be over IPv4 or IPv6. BGP information A public or private Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Autonomous System Number (ASN) for your side of the BGP session. If you are using a public ASN, you must own it. If you are using a private ASN, you can set a custom ASN value. For a 16-bit ASN, the value must be in the 64512 to 65534 range. For a 32-bit ASN, the value must be in the 4200000000 to 4294967294 range.

(Private virtual interface only) Connection\nFor connecting to a VPC in the same AWS Region, you need the virtual private gateway for your VPC. The ASN for the Amazon side of the BGP session is inherited from the virtual private gateway. When you create a virtual private gateway, you can specify your own private ASN. Otherwise, Amazon provides a default ASN. For more information, see Create a Virtual Private Gateway in the Amazon VPC User Guide. For connecting to a VPC through a Direct Connect gateway, you need the Direct Connect gateway. For more information, see Direct Connect Gateways. VLAN\nA unique virtual local area network (VLAN) tag that's not already in use on your connection. The value must be between 1 and 4094 and must comply with the Ethernet 802.1Q standard. This tag is required for any traffic traversing the AWS Direct Connect connection. If you have a hosted connection, your AWS Direct Connect Partner provides this value. You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t modify the value after you have created the virtual interface. Peer IP addresses\n A virtual interface can support a BGP peering session for IPv4, IPv6, or one of each (dual-stack). Do not use Elastic IPs (EIPs) from the Amazon Pool to create a public virtual interface. You cannot create multiple BGP sessions for the same IP addressing family on the same virtual interface. The IP address ranges are assigned to each end of the virtual interface for the BGP peering session. IPv4: (Public virtual interface only) You must specify unique public IPv4 addresses that you own. The value can be one of the following:\n\nA customer-owned IPv4 CIDRAn IP range owned by your AWS Direct Connect Partner or ISP, along with an LOA-CFA authorization\nAn AWS-provided /31 CIDR. Contact AWS Support to request a public IPv4 CIDR (and provide a use case in your request)NoteWe cannot guarantee that we will be able to fulfill all requests for AWS-provided public IPv4 addresses. (Private virtual interface only) Amazon can generate private IPv4 addresses for you. If you specify your own, ensure that you specify private CIDRs for your router interface and the AWS Direct Connect interface only (for example, do not specify other IP addresses from your local network). IPv6: Amazon automatically allocates you a /125 IPv6 CIDR. You cannot specify your own peer IPv6 addresses. Address family\nWhether the BGP peering session will be over IPv4 or IPv6. BGP information A public or private Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Autonomous System Number (ASN) for your side of the BGP session. If you are using a public ASN, you must own it. If you are using a private ASN, you can set a custom ASN value. For a 16-bit ASN, the value must be in the 64512 to 65534 range. For a 32-bit ASN, the value must be in the 4200000000 to 4294967294 range.

Setting the MTU of a virtual interface to 9001 (jumbo frames) can cause an update to the underlying physical connection if it wasn't updated to support jumbo frames. Updating the connection disrupts network connectivity for all virtual interfaces associated with the connection for up to 30 seconds. Jumbo frames apply only to propagated routes from AWS Direct Connect. If you add static routes to a route table that point to your virtual private gateway, then traffic routed through the static routes is sent using 1500 MTU.

Otherwise, Amazon provides a default ASN. For more information, see Create a Virtual Private Gateway in the Amazon VPC User Guide. For connecting to a VPC through a Direct Connect gateway, you need the Direct Connect gateway. For more information, see Direct Connect Gateways. VLAN\nA unique virtual local area network (VLAN) tag that's not already in use on your connection. The value must be between 1 and 4094 and must comply with the Ethernet 802.1Q standard.

Virtual interface name\nA name for the virtual interface. Virtual interface owner\nIf you're creating the virtual interface for another account, you need the AWS account ID of the other account. (Private virtual interface only) Connection\nFor connecting to a VPC in the same AWS Region, you need the virtual private gateway for your VPC. The ASN for the Amazon side of the BGP session is inherited from the virtual private gateway. When you create a virtual private gateway, you can specify your own private ASN. Otherwise, Amazon provides a default ASN. For more information, see Create a Virtual Private Gateway in the Amazon VPC User Guide. For connecting to a VPC through a Direct Connect gateway, you need the Direct Connect gateway. For more information, see Direct Connect Gateways. VLAN\nA unique virtual local area network (VLAN) tag that's not already in use on your connection. The value must be between 1 and 4094 and must comply with the Ethernet 802.1Q standard. This tag is required for any traffic traversing the AWS Direct Connect connection. If you have a hosted connection, your AWS Direct Connect Partner provides this value. You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t modify the value after you have created the virtual interface. Peer IP addresses\n A virtual interface can support a BGP peering session for IPv4, IPv6, or one of each (dual-stack). Do not use Elastic IPs (EIPs) from the Amazon Pool to create a public virtual interface. You cannot create multiple BGP sessions for the same IP addressing family on the same virtual interface. The IP address ranges are assigned to each end of the virtual interface for the BGP peering session. IPv4: (Public virtual interface only) You must specify unique public IPv4 addresses that you own. The value can be one of the following:\n\nA customer-owned IPv4 CIDRAn IP range owned by your AWS Direct Connect Partner or ISP, along with an LOA-CFA authorization\nAn AWS-provided /31 CIDR. Contact AWS Support to request a public IPv4 CIDR (and provide a use case in your request)NoteWe cannot guarantee that we will be able to fulfill all requests for AWS-provided public IPv4 addresses. (Private virtual interface only) Amazon can generate private IPv4 addresses for you. If you specify your own, ensure that you specify private CIDRs for your router interface and the AWS Direct Connect interface only (for example, do not specify other IP addresses from your local network). IPv6: Amazon automatically allocates you a /125 IPv6 CIDR. You cannot specify your own peer IPv6 addresses. Address family\nWhether the BGP peering session will be over IPv4 or IPv6. BGP information A public or private Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Autonomous System Number (ASN) for your side of the BGP session. If you are using a public ASN, you must own it. If you are using a private ASN, you can set a custom ASN value. For a 16-bit ASN, the value must be in the 64512 to 65534 range. For a 32-bit ASN, the value must be in the 4200000000 to 4294967294 range.

(Public virtual interface only) Prefixes you want to advertise Public IPv4 routes or IPv6 routes to advertise over BGP. You must advertise at least one prefix using BGP, up to a maximum of 1,000 prefixes. IPv4: The IPv4 CIDR can overlap with another public IPv4 CIDR announced using AWS Direct Connect when either of the following is true:\n\nThe CIDRs are from different AWS Regions. Make sure that you apply BGP community tags on the public prefixes.You use AS_PATH when you have a public ASN in an active/passive configuration.\nFor more information, see Routing policies and BGP communities.\n\nIPv6: Specify a prefix length of /64 or shorter.\n\nYou may add additional prefixes to an existing public VIF and advertise those by contacting AWS support. In your support case, provide a list of additional CIDR prefixes you want to add to the public VIF and advertise. (Private virtual interface only) Jumbo frames\nThe maximum transmission unit (MTU) of packets over AWS Direct Connect. The default is 1500. Setting the MTU of a virtual interface to 9001 (jumbo frames) can cause an update to the underlying physical connection if it wasn't updated to support jumbo frames. Updating the connection disrupts network connectivity for all virtual interfaces associated with the connection for up to 30 seconds. Jumbo frames apply only to propagated routes from AWS Direct Connect. If you add static routes to a route table that point to your virtual private gateway, then traffic routed through the static routes is sent using 1500 MTU. To check whether a connection or virtual interface supports jumbo frames, select it in the AWS Direct Connect console and find Jumbo frame capable on the virtual interface General configuration page. (Transit virtual interface only) Jumbo frames\nThe maximum transmission unit (MTU) of packets over AWS Direct Connect. The default is 1500. Setting the MTU of a virtual interface to 8500 (jumbo frames) can cause an update to the underlying physical connection if it wasn't updated to support jumbo frames.

(Private virtual interface only) Connection\nFor connecting to a VPC in the same AWS Region, you need the virtual private gateway for your VPC. The ASN for the Amazon side of the BGP session is inherited from the virtual private gateway. When you create a virtual private gateway, you can specify your own private ASN. Otherwise, Amazon provides a default ASN. For more information, see Create a Virtual Private Gateway in the Amazon VPC User Guide. For connecting to a VPC through a Direct Connect gateway, you need the Direct Connect gateway. For more information, see Direct Connect Gateways. VLAN\nA unique virtual local area network (VLAN) tag that's not already in use on your connection. The value must be between 1 and 4094 and must comply with the Ethernet 802.1Q standard. This tag is required for any traffic traversing the AWS Direct Connect connection. If you have a hosted connection, your AWS Direct Connect Partner provides this value. You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t modify the value after you have created the virtual interface. Peer IP addresses\n A virtual interface can support a BGP peering session for IPv4, IPv6, or one of each (dual-stack). Do not use Elastic IPs (EIPs) from the Amazon Pool to create a public virtual interface. You cannot create multiple BGP sessions for the same IP addressing family on the same virtual interface. The IP address ranges are assigned to each end of the virtual interface for the BGP peering session. IPv4: (Public virtual interface only) You must specify unique public IPv4 addresses that you own. The value can be one of the following:\n\nA customer-owned IPv4 CIDRAn IP range owned by your AWS Direct Connect Partner or ISP, along with an LOA-CFA authorization\nAn AWS-provided /31 CIDR.

BGP information A public or private Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Autonomous System Number (ASN) for your side of the BGP session. If you are using a public ASN, you must own it. If you are using a private ASN, you can set a custom ASN value. For a 16-bit ASN, the value must be in the 64512 to 65534 range.

"text": "Resource\nRequired information Connection\nThe AWS Direct Connect connection or link aggregation group (LAG) for which you are creating the virtual interface. Virtual interface name\nA name for the virtual interface. Virtual interface owner\nIf you're creating the virtual interface for another account, you need the AWS account ID of the other account. (Private virtual interface only) Connection\nFor connecting to a VPC in the same AWS Region, you need the virtual private gateway for your VPC. The ASN for the Amazon side of the BGP session is inherited from the virtual private gateway. When you create a virtual private gateway, you can specify your own private ASN. Otherwise, Amazon provides a default ASN. For more information, see Create a Virtual Private Gateway in the Amazon VPC User Guide. For connecting to a VPC through a Direct Connect gateway, you need the Direct Connect gateway. For more information, see Direct Connect Gateways. VLAN\nA unique virtual local area network (VLAN) tag that's not already in use on your connection. The value must be between 1 and 4094 and must comply with the Ethernet 802.1Q standard. This tag is required for any traffic traversing the AWS Direct Connect connection. If you have a hosted connection, your AWS Direct Connect Partner provides this value. You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t modify the value after you have created the virtual interface. Peer IP addresses\n A virtual interface can support a BGP peering session for IPv4, IPv6, or one of each (dual-stack). Do not use Elastic IPs (EIPs) from the Amazon Pool to create a public virtual interface. You cannot create multiple BGP sessions for the same IP addressing family on the same virtual interface. The IP address ranges are assigned to each end of the virtual interface for the BGP peering session. IPv4: (Public virtual interface only) You must specify unique public IPv4 addresses that you own. The value can be one of the following:\n\nA customer-owned IPv4 CIDRAn IP range owned by your AWS Direct Connect Partner or ISP, along with an LOA-CFA authorization\nAn AWS-provided /31 CIDR. Contact AWS Support to request a public IPv4 CIDR (and provide a use case in your request)NoteWe cannot guarantee that we will be able to fulfill all requests for AWS-provided public IPv4 addresses. (Private virtual interface only) Amazon can generate private IPv4 addresses for you. If you specify your own, ensure that you specify private CIDRs for your router interface and the AWS Direct Connect interface only (for example, do not specify other IP addresses from your local network). IPv6: Amazon automatically allocates you a /125 IPv6 CIDR. You cannot specify your own peer IPv6 addresses. Address family\nWhether the BGP peering session will be over IPv4 or IPv6. BGP information A public or private Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Autonomous System Number (ASN) for your side of the BGP session. If you are using a public ASN, you must own it. If you are using a private ASN, you can set a custom ASN value. For a 16-bit ASN, the value must be in the 64512 to 65534 range. For a 32-bit ASN, the value must be in the 4200000000 to 4294967294 range. Autonomous System (AS) prepending does not work if you use a private ASN for a public virtual interface.\n\nAWS enables MD5 by default. You cannot modify this option.\n\nAn MD5 BGP authentication key. You can provide your own, or you can let Amazon generate one for you. (Public virtual interface only) Prefixes you want to advertise Public IPv4 routes or IPv6 routes to advertise over BGP. You must advertise at least one prefix using BGP, up to a maximum of 1,000 prefixes. IPv4: The IPv4 CIDR can overlap with another public IPv4 CIDR announced using AWS Direct Connect when either of the following is true:\n\nThe CIDRs are from different AWS Regions. Make sure that you apply BGP community tags on the public prefixes.You use AS_PATH when you have a public ASN in an active/passive configuration.\nFor more information, see Routing policies and BGP communities.\n\nIPv6: Specify a prefix length of /64 or shorter.\n\nYou may add additional prefixes to an existing public VIF and advertise those by contacting AWS support. In your support case, provide a list of additional CIDR prefixes you want to add to the public VIF and advertise. (Private virtual interface only) Jumbo frames\nThe maximum transmission unit (MTU) of packets over AWS Direct Connect. The default is 1500. Setting the MTU of a virtual interface to 9001 (jumbo frames) can cause an update to the underlying physical connection if it wasn't updated to support jumbo frames. Updating the connection disrupts network connectivity for all virtual interfaces associated with the connection for up to 30 seconds. Jumbo frames apply only to propagated routes from AWS Direct Connect. If you add static routes to a route table that point to your virtual private gateway, then traffic routed through the static routes is sent using 1500 MTU. To check whether a connection or virtual interface supports jumbo frames, select it in the AWS Direct Connect console and find Jumbo frame capable on the virtual interface General configuration page. (Transit virtual interface only) Jumbo frames\nThe maximum transmission unit (MTU) of packets over AWS Direct Connect. The default is 1500. Setting the MTU of a virtual interface to 8500 (jumbo frames) can cause an update to the underlying physical connection if it wasn't updated to support jumbo frames. Updating the connection disrupts network connectivity for all virtual interfaces associated with the connection for up to 30 seconds. Jumbo frames are supported up to 8500 MTU for Direct Connect. Static routes and propagated routes configured in the Transit Gateway Route Table will support Jumbo Frames, including from EC2 instances with VPC static route table entries to the Transit Gateway Attachment. To check whether a connection or virtual interface supports jumbo frames, select it in the AWS Direct Connect console and find Jumbo frame capable on the virtual interface General configuration page.",

You cannot associate a virtual private gateway with more than one Direct Connect gateway and you cannot attach a private virtual interface to more than one Direct Connect gateway.\n\nA virtual private gateway that you associate with a Direct Connect gateway must be attached to a VPC.\n\nA virtual private gateway association proposal expires 7 days after it is created.\n\nAn accepted virtual private gateway proposal, or a deleted virtual private gateway proposal remains visible for 3 days.\n\nA virtual private gateway can be associated with a Direct Connect gateway and also attached to a virtual interface.\n\nDetaching a virtual private gateway from a VPC also disassociates the virtual private gateway from a Direct Connect gateway.",

"text": "Temporary IAM user permissions \u00e2\u0080\u0093 An IAM user can assume an IAM role to temporarily take on different permissions for a specific task. Federated user access \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Instead of creating an IAM user, you can use existing identities from AWS Directory Service, your enterprise user directory, or a web identity provider. These are known as federated users. AWS assigns a role to a federated user when access is requested through an identity provider. For more information about federated users, see Federated users and roles in the IAM User Guide. Cross-account access \u00e2\u0080\u0093 You can use an IAM role to allow someone (a trusted principal) in a different account to access resources in your account. Roles are the primary way to grant cross-account access. However, with some AWS services, you can attach a policy directly to a resource (instead of using a role as a proxy). To learn the difference between roles and resource-based policies for cross-account access, see How IAM roles differ from resource-based policies in the IAM User Guide.\n\nCross-service access \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Some AWS services use features in other AWS services. For example, when you make a call in a service, it's common for that service to run applications in Amazon EC2 or store objects in Amazon S3. A service might do this using the calling principal's permissions, using a service role, or using a service-linked role. Principal permissions \u00e2\u0080\u0093 When you use an IAM user or role to perform actions in AWS, you are considered a principal. Policies grant permissions to a principal. When you use some services, you might perform an action that then triggers another action in a different service. In this case, you must have permissions to perform both actions. To see whether an action requires additional dependent actions in a policy, see Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for AWS Direct Connect in the Service Authorization Reference. Service role \u00e2\u0080\u0093 A service role is an IAM role that a service assumes to perform actions on your behalf. An IAM administrator can create, modify, and delete a service role from within IAM. For more information, see Creating a role to delegate permissions to an AWS service in the IAM User Guide. Service-linked role \u00e2\u0080\u0093 A service-linked role is a type of service role that is linked to an AWS service. The service can assume the role to perform an action on your behalf. Service-linked roles appear in your IAM account and are owned by the service. An IAM administrator can view, but not edit the permissions for service-linked roles. Applications running on Amazon EC2 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 You can use an IAM role to manage temporary credentials for applications that are running on an EC2 instance and making AWS CLI or AWS API requests. This is preferable to storing access keys within the EC2 instance. To assign an AWS role to an EC2 instance and make it available to all of its applications, you create an instance profile that is attached to the instance. An instance profile contains the role and enables programs that are running on the EC2 instance to get temporary credentials. For more information, see Using an IAM role to grant permissions to applications running on Amazon EC2 instances in the IAM User Guide.",

For more information, see Get started using permissions with AWS managed policies in the IAM User Guide.\n\nGrant least privilege \u00e2\u0080\u0093 When you create custom policies, grant only the permissions required to perform a task. Start with a minimum set of permissions and grant additional permissions as necessary.

For more information, see Grant least privilege in the IAM User Guide.\n\nEnable MFA for sensitive operations \u00e2\u0080\u0093 For extra security, require IAM users to use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to access sensitive resources or API operations. For more information, see Using multi-factor authentication (MFA) in AWS in the IAM User Guide.\n\nUse policy conditions for extra security \u00e2\u0080\u0093 To the extent that it's practical, define the conditions under which your identity-based policies allow access to a resource.

"text": "Ensure that you are advertising a route for your on-premises network prefix over the BGP session. For a private virtual interface, this can be a private or public network prefix. For a public virtual interface, this must be your publicly routable network prefix.\n\nFor a private virtual interface, ensure that your VPC security groups and network ACLs allow inbound and outbound traffic for your on-premises network prefix. For more information, see Security Groups and Network ACLs in the Amazon VPC User Guide.\n\nFor a private virtual interface, ensure that your VPC route tables have prefixes pointing to the virtual private gateway to which your private virtual interface is connected. For example, if you prefer to have all your traffic routed towards your on-premises network by default, you can add the default route (0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0) with the virtual private gateway as the target in your VPC route tables. Alternatively, enable route propagation to automatically update routes in your route tables based on your dynamic BGP route advertisement. You can have up to 100 propagated routes per route table. This limit cannot be increased. For more information, see Enabling and Disabling Route Propagation in the Amazon VPC User Guide. If the above steps do not resolve your routing issues, contact AWS Support.",

If your configuration does not contain the appropriate redundant connections, the BGP peering session fails, and traffic does not get routed. When the test completes, or you manually stop the test, AWS restores the BGP session. After the test is complete, you can use the AWS Direct Connect Resiliency Toolkit to adjust your configuration.",
