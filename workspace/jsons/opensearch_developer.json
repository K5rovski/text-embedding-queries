These services now contain separate resource types for domains running Elasticsearch (AWS::Elasticsearch::Domain) versus domains running OpenSearch (AWS::OpenSearch::Domain).",

Under Network, choose Public access.\n\nIn the fine-grained access control settings, choose Create master user. Provide a user name and password.\n\nFor now, ignore the SAML authentication and Amazon Cognito authentication sections.\n\nFor Access policy, choose Only use fine-grained access control. In this tutorial, fine-grained access control handles authentication, not the domain access policy.\n\nIgnore the rest of the settings and choose Create.

"text": "To create an OpenSearch Service domain (console)\nGo to https://aws.amazon.com and choose Sign In to the Console.\n\nUnder Analytics, choose Amazon OpenSearch Service.\n\nChoose Create domain.\n\nFor Domain name, enter a domain name. The name must meet the following criteria: Unique to your account and AWS Region\n\nStarts with a lowercase letter\n\nContains between 3 and 28 characters\n\nContains only lowercase letters a-z, the numbers 0-9, and the hyphen (-) If you want to use a custom endpoint rather than the standard one of https://search-mydomain-1a2a3a4a5a6a7a8a9a0a9a8a7a.us-east-1.es.amazonaws.com , choose Enable custom endpoint and provide a name and certificate. For more information, see Creating a custom endpoint for Amazon OpenSearch Service.\n\nFor Deployment type, choose the option that best matches the purpose of your domain: Production domains use Multi-AZ and dedicated master nodes for higher availability.\n\nDevelopment and testing domains use a single Availability Zone.\n\nCustom domains let you choose from all configuration options.\nImportantDifferent deployment types present different options on subsequent pages. These steps include all options (the Custom deployment type). For Version, choose the version of OpenSearch or legacy Elasticsearch OSS to use. We recommend that you choose the latest version of OpenSearch. For more information, see Supported versions of OpenSearch and Elasticsearch.\n(Optional) If you chose an OpenSearch version for your domain, select Enable compatibility mode to make OpenSearch report its version as 7.10, which allows certain Elasticsearch OSS clients and plugins that check the version before connecting to continue working with the service.\n\nFor Auto-Tune, choose whether to allow OpenSearch Service to suggest memory-related configuration changes to your domain to improve speed and stability. For more information, see Auto-Tune for Amazon OpenSearch Service.\n(Optional) Select Add maintenance window to schedule a recurring window during which which Auto-Tune updates the domain.\n\nUnder Data nodes, choose the number of availability zones. For more information, see Configuring a multi-AZ domain in Amazon OpenSearch Service.\nNoteThe OpenSearch Service console doesn't support moving from multiple availability zones to a single availability zone after the domain is created. If you choose 2 or 3 availability zones and later want to move to 1, you must disable the ZoneAwarenessEnabled parameter using the AWS CLI or configuration API.\n\nFor Instance type, choose an instance type for your data nodes. For more information, see Supported instance types in Amazon OpenSearch Service.\nNoteNot all Availability Zones support all instance types. If you choose 3-AZ, we recommend choosing current-generation instance types such as R5 or I3.\n\nFor Number of nodes, choose the number of data nodes.\nFor maximum values, see Cluster and instance limits. Single-node clusters are fine for development and testing, but should not be used for production workloads. For more guidance, see Sizing Amazon OpenSearch Service domains and Configuring a multi-AZ domain in Amazon OpenSearch Service.\n\nFor Storage type, choose either EBS (default) or Instance. For guidance on creating especially large domains, see Petabyte scale for Amazon OpenSearch Service. If you choose EBS, the following options appear:\n\nFor EBS volume type, choose a volume type.\nIf you choose Provisioned IOPS (SSD), then under Provisioned IOPS, enter the baseline IOPS performance that you want. For more information, see Amazon EBS volumes in the Amazon EC2 documentation. For EBS storage size per node, enter the size of the EBS volume that you want to attach to each data node.\nEBS volume size is per node. You can calculate the total cluster size for the OpenSearch Service domain by multiplying the number of data nodes by the EBS volume size. The minimum and maximum size of an EBS volume depends on both the specified EBS volume type and the instance type that it's attached to. To learn more, see EBS Volume Size Limits. Choose the type and number of dedicated master nodes. Dedicated master nodes increase cluster stability and are required for domains that have instance counts greater than 10. We recommend three dedicated master nodes for production domains.\nNoteYou can choose different instance types for your dedicated master nodes and data nodes. For example, you might select general purpose or storage-optimized instances for your data nodes, but compute-optimized instances for your dedicated master nodes.\n\n(Optional) To enable UltraWarm storage, choose Enable UltraWarm data nodes. Each instance type has a maximum amount of storage that it can address. Multiply that amount by the number of warm data nodes for the total addressable warm storage.\n\n(Optional) To enable cold storage, choose Enable cold storage. You must enable UltraWarm to enable cold storage.\n\n(Optional) For domains running OpenSearch or Elasticsearch 5.3 and later, the Snapshot configuration is irrelevant. For more information about automated snapshots, see Creating index snapshots in Amazon OpenSearch Service.\n\nUnder Network, choose either VPC access or Public access. If you choose Public access, skip to the next step. If you choose VPC access, make sure you meet the prerequisites, then do the following:\n\nFor VPC, choose the ID of the VPC you want to use.\nNoteThe VPC and domain must be in the same AWS Region, and you must select a VPC with tenancy set to Default. OpenSearch Service does not yet support VPCs that use dedicated tenancy.\n\nFor Subnet, choose a subnet. If you enabled Multi-AZ, you must choose two or three subnets. OpenSearch Service will place a VPC endpoint and elastic network interfaces in the subnets.\nNoteYou must reserve sufficient IP addresses for the network interfaces in the subnet (or subnets). For more information, see Reserving IP addresses in a VPC subnet.\n\nFor Security groups, choose one or more VPC security groups that allow your required application to reach the OpenSearch Service domain on the ports (80 or 443) and protocols (HTTP or HTTPs) exposed by the domain. For more information, see Launching your Amazon OpenSearch Service domains within a VPC.\n\nFor IAM Role, keep the default role. OpenSearch Service uses this predefined role (also known as a service-linked role) to access your VPC and to place a VPC endpoint and network interfaces in the subnet of the VPC. For more information, see Service-linked role for VPC access. Enable or disable fine-grained access control: If you want to use IAM for user management, choose Set IAM ARN as master user and specify the ARN for an IAM role.\n\nIf you want to use the internal user database, choose Create master user and specify a user name and password.\n\nWhichever option you choose, the master user can access all indexes in the cluster and all OpenSearch APIs. For guidance on which option to choose, see Key concepts.\nIf you disable fine-grained access control, you can still control access to your domain by placing it within a VPC, applying a restrictive access policy, or both. You must enable node-to-node encryption and encryption at rest to use fine-grained access control.\nNoteWe strongly recommend enabling fine-grained access control to protect the data on your domain. Fine-grained access control provides security at the cluster, index, document, and field levels.\n\n(Optional) If you want to use SAML authentication for OpenSearch Dashboards, choose Prepare SAML authentication. After the domain is available, see SAML authentication for OpenSearch Dashboards for additional steps.\n\n(Optional) If you want to use Amazon Cognito authentication for OpenSearch Dashboards, choose Enable Amazon Cognito authentication.\n\nChoose the Amazon Cognito user pool and identity pool that you want to use for OpenSearch Dashboards authentication. For guidance on creating these resources, see Configuring Amazon Cognito authentication for OpenSearch Dashboards. For Domain access policy, choose an access policy or configure one of your own. If you choose to create a custom policy, you can configure it yourself or import one from another domain. For more information, see Identity and Access Management in Amazon OpenSearch Service.\nNoteIf you enabled VPC access, you can't use IP-based policies. Instead, you can use security groups to control which IP addresses can access the domain. For more information, see About access policies on VPC domains.\n\n(Optional) To require that all requests to the domain arrive over HTTPS, select Require HTTPS for all traffic to the domain.\n\n(Optional) To enable node-to-node encryption, select Node-to-node encryption. For more information, see Node-to-node encryption for Amazon OpenSearch Service.\n\n(Optional) To enable encryption of data at rest, select Enable encryption of data at rest.\nSelect Use AWS owned key to have OpenSearch Service create an AWS KMS encryption key on your behalf (or use the one that it already created). Otherwise, choose your own KMS key. For more information, see Encryption of data at rest for Amazon OpenSearch Service.\n\n(Optional) Add tags to describe your domain so you can categorize and filter on that information. For more information, see Tagging Amazon OpenSearch Service domains.\n\n(Optional) Expand Advanced cluster settings. For a summary of these options, see Advanced cluster settings.\n\nChoose Create.",

You can always update this setting after you finish testing.\n\nCreate an Amazon Linux Amazon EC2 instance in the same VPC, subnet, and security group as your OpenSearch Service domain.\nBecause this instance is for testing purposes and needs to do very little work, choose an inexpensive instance type like t2.micro. Assign the instance a public IP address and either create a new key pair or choose an existing one. If you create a new key, download it to your ~/.ssh directory.\nTo learn more about creating instances, see Getting started with Amazon EC2 Linux instances.\n\nAdd an internet gateway to your VPC.\n\nIn the route table for your VPC, add a new route. For Destination, specify a CIDR block that contains your computer's public IP address. For Target, specify the internet gateway you just created.\nFor example, you might specify 123.123.123.123/32 for just your computer or 123.123.123.0/24 for a range of computers.\n\nFor the security group, specify two inbound rules: Type\nProtocol\nPort Range\nSource SSH (22)\nTCP (6)\n22\nyour-cidr-block HTTPS (443)\nTCP (6)\n443\nyour-security-group-id The first rule lets you SSH into your EC2 instance. The second allows the EC2 instance to communicate with the OpenSearch Service domain over HTTPS.\n\nFrom the terminal, run the following command:\nssh -i ~/.ssh/your-key.pem ec2-user@your-ec2-instance-public-ip -N -L 9200:vpc-domain-name.region.es.amazonaws.com:443\nThis command creates an SSH tunnel that forwards requests to https://localhost:9200 to your OpenSearch Service domain through the EC2 instance. Specifying port 9200 in the command simulates a local OpenSearch install, but use whichever port you'd like. OpenSearch Service only accepts connections over port 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS).\nThe command provides no feedback and runs indefinitely. To stop it, press Ctrl + C.\n\nNavigate to https://localhost:9200/_dashboards/ in your web browser. You might need to acknowledge a security exception.\nAlternately, you can send requests to https://localhost:9200 using curl, Postman, or your favorite programming language.\nTipIf you encounter curl errors due to a certificate mismatch, try the --insecure flag.",

To see all snapshot repositories, run the following command:\ncurl -XGET 'domain-endpoint/_snapshot?pretty'\nAfter you identify the repository, run the following command to see all snapshots:\ncurl -XGET 'domain-endpoint/_snapshot/repository-name/_all?pretty'\nNoteMost automated snapshots are stored in the cs-automated repository. If your domain encrypts data at rest, they're stored in the cs-automated-enc repository. If you don't see the manual snapshot repository you're looking for, make sure you registered it to the domain.\n\n(Optional) Delete or rename one or more indexes in the OpenSearch Service domain if you have naming conflicts between indexes on the cluster and indexes in the snapshot. You can't restore a snapshot of your indexes to an OpenSearch cluster that already contains indexes with the same names.\nYou have the following options if you have index naming conflicts: Delete the indexes on the existing OpenSearch Service domain and then restore the snapshot.\n\nRename the indexes as you restore them from the snapshot and reindex them later.\n\nRestore the snapshot to a different OpenSearch Service domain (only possible with manual snapshots).\n\nThe following command deletes all existing indexes in a domain:\ncurl -XDELETE 'domain-endpoint/_all'\nHowever, if you don't plan to restore all indices, you can just delete one:\ncurl -XDELETE 'domain-endpoint/index-name'\n\nTo restore a snapshot, run the following command:\ncurl -XPOST 'domain-endpoint/_snapshot/repository-name/snapshot-name/_restore'\nDue to special permissions on the OpenSearch Dashboards and fine-grained access control indices, attempts to restore all indexes might fail, especially if you try to restore from an automated snapshot. The following example restores just one index, my-index, from 2020-snapshot in the cs-automated snapshot repository:\ncurl -XPOST 'domain-endpoint/_snapshot/cs-automated/2020-snapshot/_restore' -d '{\"indices\": \"my-index\"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'\nAlternately, you might want to restore all indexes except the Dashboards and fine-grained access control indices:\ncurl -XPOST 'domain-endpoint/_snapshot/cs-automated/2020-snapshot/_restore' -d '{\"indices\": \"-.kibana*,-.opendistro*\"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'",

"text": "Issue\nDescription Too many shards per node\nOpenSearch, as well as 7.x versions of Elasticsearch, have a default setting of no more than 1,000 shards per node. If a node in your current cluster exceeds this setting, OpenSearch Service doesn't allow you to upgrade. See Exceeded maximum shard limit for troubleshooting options. Domain in processing\nThe domain is in the middle of a configuration change. Check upgrade eligibility after the operation completes. Red cluster status\nOne or more indices in the cluster is red. For troubleshooting steps, see Red cluster status. High error rate\nThe cluster is returning a large number of 5xx errors when attempting to process requests. This problem is usually the result of too many simultaneous read or write requests. Consider reducing traffic to the cluster or scaling your domain. Split brain\nSplit brain means that your cluster has more than one master node and has split into two clusters that never will rejoin on their own. You can avoid split brain by using the recommended number of dedicated master nodes. For help recovering from split brain, contact AWS Support. Master node not found\nOpenSearch Service can't find the cluster's master node. If your domain uses multi-AZ, an Availability Zone failure might have caused the cluster to lose quorum and be unable to elect a new master node. If the issue does not self-resolve, contact AWS Support. Too many pending tasks\nThe master node is under heavy load and has many pending tasks. Consider reducing traffic to the cluster or scaling your domain. Impaired storage volume\nThe disk volume of one or more nodes isn't functioning properly. This issue often occurs alongside other issues, like a high error rate or too many pending tasks. If it occurs in isolation and doesn't self-resolve, contact AWS Support. KMS key issue\nThe KMS key that is used to encrypt the domain is either inaccessible or missing. For more information, see Monitoring domains that encrypt data at rest. Snapshot in progress\nThe domain is currently taking a snapshot. Check upgrade eligibility after the snapshot finishes. Also check that you can list manual snapshot repositories, list snapshots within those repositories, and take manual snapshots. If OpenSearch Service is unable to check whether a snapshot is in progress, upgrades can fail. Snapshot timeout or failure\nThe pre-upgrade snapshot took too long to complete or failed. Check cluster health, and try again. If the problem persists, contact AWS Support. Incompatible indices\nOne or more indices is incompatible with the target version. This problem can occur if you migrated the indices from an older version of OpenSearch or Elasticsearch. Reindex the indices and try again. High disk usage\nDisk usage for the cluster is above 90%. Delete data or scale the domain, and try again. High JVM usage\nJVM memory pressure is above 75%. Reduce traffic to the cluster or scale the domain, and try again. OpenSearch Dashboards alias problem\n.kibana is already configured as an alias and maps to an incompatible index, likely one from an earlier version of OpenSearch Dashboards. Reindex, and try again. Red Dashboards status\nOpenSearch Dashboards status is red. Try using Dashboards when the upgrade completes. If the red status persists, resolve it manually, and try again. Cross-cluster compatibility\n\nYou can only upgrade if cross-cluster compatibility is maintained between the source and destination domains after the upgrade. During the upgrade process, any incompatible connections are identified. To proceed, either upgrade the remote domain or delete the incompatible connections. Note that if replication is active on the domain, you can't resume it once you delete the connection. Other OpenSearch Service service issue\nIssues with OpenSearch Service itself might cause your domain to display as ineligible for an upgrade. If none of the preceding conditions apply to your domain and the problem persists for more than a day, contact AWS Support.",

For more information, see Making configuration changes in Amazon OpenSearch Service.\nRelevant statistics: Maximum SearchableDocuments\n\nThe total number of searchable documents across all data nodes in the cluster.\nRelevant statistics: Minimum, Maximum, Average DeletedDocuments\n\nThe total number of documents marked for deletion across all data nodes in the cluster. These documents no longer appear in search results, but OpenSearch only removes deleted documents from disk during segment merges. This metric increases after delete requests and decreases after segment merges.\nRelevant statistics: Minimum, Maximum, Average CPUUtilization\n\nThe percentage of CPU usage for data nodes in the cluster. Maximum shows the node with the highest CPU usage. Average represents all nodes in the cluster. This metric is also available for individual nodes.\nRelevant statistics: Maximum, Average FreeStorageSpace\n\nThe free space for data nodes in the cluster. Sum shows total free space for the cluster, but you must leave the period at one minute to get an accurate value. Minimum and Maximum show the nodes with the least and most free space, respectively. This metric is also available for individual nodes. OpenSearch Service throws a ClusterBlockException when this metric reaches 0. To recover, you must either delete indexes, add larger instances, or add EBS-based storage to existing instances. To learn more, see Lack of available storage space.\nThe OpenSearch Service console displays this value in GiB. The Amazon CloudWatch console displays it in MiB.\nNoteFreeStorageSpace will always be lower than the values that the OpenSearch _cluster/stats and _cat/allocation APIs provide. OpenSearch Service reserves a percentage of the storage space on each instance for internal operations. For more information, see Calculating storage requirements.\nRelevant statistics: Minimum, Maximum, Average, Sum ClusterUsedSpace\n\nThe total used space for the cluster. You must leave the period at one minute to get an accurate value.\nThe OpenSearch Service console displays this value in GiB. The Amazon CloudWatch console displays it in MiB.\nRelevant statistics: Minimum, Maximum ClusterIndexWritesBlocked\n\nIndicates whether your cluster is accepting or blocking incoming write requests. A value of 0 means that the cluster is accepting requests. A value of 1 means that it is blocking requests.\nSome common factors include the following: FreeStorageSpace is too low or JVMMemoryPressure is too high. To alleviate this issue, consider adding more disk space or scaling your cluster.\nRelevant statistics: Maximum JVMMemoryPressure\n\nThe maximum percentage of the Java heap used for all data nodes in the cluster. OpenSearch Service uses half of an instance's RAM for the Java heap, up to a heap size of 32 GiB. You can scale instances vertically up to 64 GiB of RAM, at which point you can scale horizontally by adding instances. See Recommended CloudWatch alarms for Amazon OpenSearch Service.\nRelevant statistics: Maximum\nNoteThe logic for this metric changed in a recent service software update. For more information, see the release notes. AutomatedSnapshotFailure\n\nThe number of failed automated snapshots for the cluster. A value of 1 indicates that no automated snapshot was taken for the domain in the previous 36 hours.\nRelevant statistics: Minimum, Maximum CPUCreditBalance\n\nThe remaining CPU credits available for data nodes in the cluster. A CPU credit provides the performance of a full CPU core for one minute. For more information, see CPU credits in the Amazon EC2 Developer Guide. This metric is available only for the T2 instance types.\nRelevant statistics: Minimum OpenSearchDashboardsHealthyNodes (previously KibanaHealthyNodes)\n\nA health check for OpenSearch Dashboards. If the minimum, maximum, and average are all equal to 1, Dashboards is behaving normally. If you have 10 nodes with a maximum of 1, minimum of 0, and average of 0.7, this means 7 nodes (70%) are healthy and 3 nodes (30%) are unhealthy.\nRelevant statistics: Minimum, Maximum, Average KibanaReportingFailedRequestSysErrCount\n\nThe number of requests to generate OpenSearch Dashboards reports that failed due to server problems or feature limitations.\nRelevant statistics: Sum KibanaReportingFailedRequestUserErrCount\n\nThe number of requests to generate OpenSearch Dashboards reports that failed due to client issues.\nRelevant statistics: Sum KibanaReportingRequestCount\n\nThe total number of requests to generate OpenSearch Dashboards reports.\nRelevant statistics: Sum KibanaReportingSuccessCount\n\nThe number of successful requests to generate OpenSearch Dashboards reports.\nRelevant statistics: Sum KMSKeyError\n\nA value of 1 indicates that the AWS KMS key used to encrypt data at rest has been disabled. To restore the domain to normal operations, re-enable the key. The console displays this metric only for domains that encrypt data at rest.\nRelevant statistics: Minimum, Maximum KMSKeyInaccessible\n\nA value of 1 indicates that the AWS KMS key used to encrypt data at rest has been deleted or revoked its grants to OpenSearch Service. You can't recover domains that are in this state. If you have a manual snapshot, though, you can use it to migrate the domain's data to a new domain. The console displays this metric only for domains that encrypt data at rest.\nRelevant statistics: Minimum, Maximum InvalidHostHeaderRequests\n\nThe number of HTTP requests made to the OpenSearch cluster that included an invalid (or missing) host header. Valid requests include the domain hostname as the host header value. OpenSearch Service rejects invalid requests for public access domains that don't have a restrictive access policy. We recommend applying a restrictive access policy to all domains.\nIf you see large values for this metric, confirm that your OpenSearch clients include the domain hostname (and not, for example, its IP address) in their requests.\nRelevant statistics: Sum OpenSearchRequests\n\nThe number of requests made to the OpenSearch cluster.\nRelevant statistics: Sum 2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx\n\nThe number of requests to the domain that resulted in the given HTTP response code (2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx).\nRelevant statistics: Sum",

"text": "To enable log publishing to CloudWatch (console)\nGo to https://aws.amazon.com, and then choose Sign In to the Console.\n\nUnder Analytics, choose Amazon OpenSearch Service.\n\nSelect the domain you want to update.\n\nOn the Logs tab, select a log type and choose Enable.\n\nCreate a new CloudWatch log group or choose an existing one.\nNoteIf you plan to enable multiple logs, we recommend publishing each to its own log group. This separation makes the logs easier to scan.\n\nChoose an access policy that contains the appropriate permissions, or create a policy using the JSON that the console provides:\n{ \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Principal\": { \"Service\": \"es.amazonaws.com\" }, \"Action\": [ \"logs:PutLogEvents\", \"logs:PutLogEventsBatch\", \"logs:CreateLogStream\" ], \"Resource\": \"cw_log_group_arn:*\" } ]\n}\nWe recommend that you add the aws:SourceAccount and aws:SourceArn condition keys to the policy to protect yourself against the confused deputy problem. The source account is the owner of the domain and the source ARN is the ARN of the domain. Your domain must be on service software R20211203 or later in order to add these condition keys.\nFor example, you could add the following condition block to the policy:\n\"Condition\": { \"StringEquals\": { \"aws:SourceAccount\": \"account-id\" }, \"ArnLike\": { \"aws:SourceArn\": \"arn:aws:es:region:account-id:domain/domain-name\" }\n}\nImportantCloudWatch Logs supports 10 resource policies per Region. If you plan to enable logs for several OpenSearch Service domains, you should create and reuse a broader policy that includes multiple log groups to avoid reaching this limit. For steps on updating your policy, see Enabling log publishing (AWS CLI).\n\nChoose Enable.\nThe status of your domain changes from Active to Processing. The status must return to Active before log publishing is enabled. This change typically takes 30 minutes, but can take longer depending on your domain configuration.",

Encrypted OpenSearch Service domains don't support manual key rotation, which involves creating a new key and updating any references to the old key. To learn more, see Rotating keys in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.\n\nCertain instance types don't support encryption of data at rest. For details, see Supported instance types in Amazon OpenSearch Service.\n\nDomains that encrypt data at rest use a different repository name for their automated snapshots. For more information, see Restoring snapshots.\n\nEncrypting an OpenSearch Service domain requires a grant, and each encryption key has a limit of 500 grants per principal. This limit means that the maximum number of OpenSearch Service domains that you can encrypt using a single key is 500. Currently, OpenSearch Service supports a maximum of 100 domains per account (per Region), so this grant limit is of no consequence. If the domain limit per account increases, however, the grant limit might become relevant.\nIf you need to encrypt more than 500 domains at that time, you can create additional keys. Keys are regional, not global, so if you operate in more than one AWS Region, you already need multiple keys.",

The configuration API endpoints use the following format:\nes.region.amazonaws.com/2021-01-01/\nFor example, the following request makes a configuration change to the movies domain, but you have to sign it yourself (not recommended):\nPOST https://es.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/2021-01-01/opensearch/domain/movies/config\n{ \"ClusterConfig\": { \"InstanceType\": \"c5.xlarge.search\" }\n}\nIf you use one of the SDKs, such as Boto 3, the SDK automatically handles the request signing:\nimport boto3\n\nclient = boto3.client(es)\nresponse = client.update_domain_config( DomainName='movies', ClusterConfig={ 'InstanceType': 'c5.xlarge.search' }\n)\nFor a Java code sample, see Using the AWS SDKs to interact with Amazon OpenSearch Service.\n\nTo make calls to the OpenSearch APIs, you must sign your own requests.

For example, you can give a user permissions to delete one particular domain without giving that user permissions to delete any domain. Other actions apply only to the service itself. For example, es:ListDomainNames makes no sense in the context of a single domain and thus requires a wildcard.\nImportantResource-based policies differ from resource-level permissions. Resource-based policies are full JSON policies that attach to domains. Resource-level permissions let you restrict actions to particular domains or subresources. In practice, you can think of resource-level permissions as an optional part of a resource- or identity-based policy.\nThe following identity-based policy lists all es: actions and groups them according to whether they apply to the domain subresources (test-domain/*), to the domain configuration (test-domain), or only to the service (*):\n{ \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": [ \"es:ESHttpDelete\", \"es:ESHttpGet\", \"es:ESHttpHead\", \"es:ESHttpPost\", \"es:ESHttpPut\", \"es:ESHttpPatch\" ], \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:es:us-west-1:987654321098:domain/test-domain/*\" }, { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": [ \"es:AddTags\", \"es:AssociatePackage\", \"es:CreateDomain\", \"es:CreateOutboundConnection\", \"es:DeleteDomain\", \"es:DescribeDomain\", \"es:DescribeDomainAutoTunes\", \"es:DescribeDomainConfig\", \"es:DescribeDomains\", \"es:DissociatePackage\", \"es:ESCrossClusterGet\", \"es:GetCompatibleVersions\", \"es:GetUpgradeHistory\", \"es:GetUpgradeStatus\", \"es:ListPackagesForDomain\", \"es:ListTags\", \"es:RemoveTags\", \"es:StartServiceSoftwareUpdate\", \"es:UpdateDomainConfig\", \"es:UpdateNotificationStatus\", \"es:UpgradeDomain\" ], \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:es:us-west-1:987654321098:domain/test-domain\" }, { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": [ \"es:AcceptInboundConnection\", \"es:CancelServiceSoftwareUpdate\", \"es:CreatePackage\", \"es:CreateServiceRole\", \"es:DeletePackage\", \"es:DescribeInboundConnections\", \"es:DescribeInstanceTypeLimits\", \"es:DescribeOutboundConnections\", \"es:DescribePackages\", \"es:DescribeReservedInstanceOfferings\", \"es:DescribeReservedInstances\", \"es:GetPackageVersionHistory\", \"es:ListDomainNames\", \"es:ListDomainsForPackage\", \"es:ListInstanceTypeDetails\", \"es:ListInstanceTypes\", \"es:ListNotifications\", \"es:ListVersions\", \"es:PurchaseReservedInstanceOffering\", \"es:RejectInboundConnection\", \"es:UpdatePackage\" ], \"Resource\": \"*\" } ]\n}\nNoteWhile resource-level permissions for es:CreateDomain might seem unintuitive\u00e2\u0080\u0094after all, why give a user permissions to create a domain that already exists?\u00e2\u0080\u0094the use of a wildcard lets you enforce a simple naming scheme for your domains, such as \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:es:us-west-1:987654321098:domain/my-team-name-*\".\nOf course, nothing prevents you from including actions alongside less restrictive resource elements, such as the following:\n{ \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": [ \"es:ESHttpGet\", \"es:DescribeDomain\" ], \"Resource\": \"*\" } ]\n}\nTo learn more about pairing actions and resources, see the Resource element in this table. Condition\n\nOpenSearch Service supports most conditions that are described in AWS global condition context keys in the IAM User Guide. Notable exceptions include the aws:SecureTransport and aws:PrincipalTag keys, which OpenSearch Service does not support.\nWhen configuring an IP-based policy, you specify the IP addresses or CIDR block as a condition, such as the following:\n\"Condition\": { \"IpAddress\": { \"aws:SourceIp\": [ \"192.0.2.0/32\" ] }\n}\nAs noted in Identity-based policies, the aws:ResourceTag, aws:RequestTag, and aws:TagKeys condition keys only apply to the configuration API, not the OpenSearch APIs. Resource\n\nOpenSearch Service uses Resource elements in three basic ways: For actions that apply to OpenSearch Service itself, like es:ListDomainNames, or to allow full access, use the following syntax:\n\"Resource\": \"*\"\n\nFor actions that involve a domain's configuration, like es:DescribeDomain, you can use the following syntax:\n\"Resource\": \"arn:aws:es:region:aws-account-id:domain/domain-name\"\n\nFor actions that apply to a domain's subresources, like es:ESHttpGet, you can use the following syntax:\n\"Resource\": \"arn:aws:es:region:aws-account-id:domain/domain-name/*\"\nYou don't have to use a wildcard. OpenSearch Service lets you define a different access policy for each OpenSearch index or API. For example, you might limit a user's permissions to the test-index index:\n\"Resource\": \"arn:aws:es:region:aws-account-id:domain/domain-name/test-index\"\nInstead of full access to test-index, you might prefer to limit the policy to just the search API:\n\"Resource\": \"arn:aws:es:region:aws-account-id:domain/domain-name/test-index/_search\"\nYou can even control access to individual documents:\n\"Resource\": \"arn:aws:es:region:aws-account-id:domain/domain-name/test-index/test-type/1\"\nEssentially, if OpenSearch expresses the subresource as a URI, you can control access to it using an access policy. For even more control over which resources a user can access, see Fine-grained access control in Amazon OpenSearch Service.\n\nFor details about which actions support resource-level permissions, see the Action element in this table.",

Note that some actions have been deprecated and replaced with engine-agnostic names. es:AcceptInboundConnection\n\nes:AddTags\n\nes:AssociatePackage\n\nes:CancelServiceSoftwareUpdate\n\nes:CreateOutboundConnection\n\nes:CreateDomain\n\nes:CreatePackage\n\nes:CreateServiceRole\n\nes:DeleteDomain\n\nes:DeleteInboundConnection\n\nes:DeleteOutboundConnection\n\nes:DeletePackage\n\nes:DescribeDomain\n\nes:DescribeDomains\n\nes:DescribeDomainAutoTunes\n\nes:DescribeDomainConfig\n\nes:DescribeInboundConnections\n\nes:DescribeInstanceTypeLimits\n\nes:DescribeOutboundConnections\n\nes:DescribePackages\n\nes:DescribeReservedInstanceOfferings\n\nes:DescribeReservedInstances\n\nes:DissociatePackage\n\nes:ESCrossClusterGet\n\nes:GetCompatibleVersions\n\nes:GetPackageVersionHistory\n\nes:GetUpgradeHistory\n\nes:GetUpgradeStatus\n\nes:ListDomainNames\n\nes:ListDomainsForPackage\n\nes:ListInstanceTypeDetails\n\nes:ListInstanceTypes\n\nes:ListNotifications\n\nes:ListPackagesForDomain\n\nes:ListVersions\n\nes:ListTags\n\nes:PurchaseReservedInstanceOffering\n\nes:RemoveTags\n\nes:RejectInboundConnection\n\nes:StartServiceSoftwareUpdate\n\nes:UpdateDomainConfig\n\nes:UpdateNotificationStatus\n\nes:UpdatePackage\n\nes:UpgradeDomain\n\nTipYou can use wildcards to specify a subset of actions, such as \"Action\":\"es:*\" or \"Action\":\"es:Describe*\".\nCertain es: actions support resource-level permissions. For example, you can give a user permissions to delete one particular domain without giving that user permissions to delete any domain. Other actions apply only to the service itself. For example, es:ListDomainNames makes no sense in the context of a single domain and thus requires a wildcard.\nImportantResource-based policies differ from resource-level permissions. Resource-based policies are full JSON policies that attach to domains. Resource-level permissions let you restrict actions to particular domains or subresources. In practice, you can think of resource-level permissions as an optional part of a resource- or identity-based policy.\nThe following identity-based policy lists all es: actions and groups them according to whether they apply to the domain subresources (test-domain/*), to the domain configuration (test-domain), or only to the service (*):\n{ \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": [ \"es:ESHttpDelete\", \"es:ESHttpGet\", \"es:ESHttpHead\", \"es:ESHttpPost\", \"es:ESHttpPut\", \"es:ESHttpPatch\" ], \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:es:us-west-1:987654321098:domain/test-domain/*\" }, { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": [ \"es:AddTags\", \"es:AssociatePackage\", \"es:CreateDomain\", \"es:CreateOutboundConnection\", \"es:DeleteDomain\", \"es:DescribeDomain\", \"es:DescribeDomainAutoTunes\", \"es:DescribeDomainConfig\", \"es:DescribeDomains\", \"es:DissociatePackage\", \"es:ESCrossClusterGet\", \"es:GetCompatibleVersions\", \"es:GetUpgradeHistory\", \"es:GetUpgradeStatus\", \"es:ListPackagesForDomain\", \"es:ListTags\", \"es:RemoveTags\", \"es:StartServiceSoftwareUpdate\", \"es:UpdateDomainConfig\", \"es:UpdateNotificationStatus\", \"es:UpgradeDomain\" ], \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:es:us-west-1:987654321098:domain/test-domain\" }, { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": [ \"es:AcceptInboundConnection\", \"es:CancelServiceSoftwareUpdate\", \"es:CreatePackage\", \"es:CreateServiceRole\", \"es:DeletePackage\", \"es:DescribeInboundConnections\", \"es:DescribeInstanceTypeLimits\", \"es:DescribeOutboundConnections\", \"es:DescribePackages\", \"es:DescribeReservedInstanceOfferings\", \"es:DescribeReservedInstances\", \"es:GetPackageVersionHistory\", \"es:ListDomainNames\", \"es:ListDomainsForPackage\", \"es:ListInstanceTypeDetails\", \"es:ListInstanceTypes\", \"es:ListNotifications\", \"es:ListVersions\", \"es:PurchaseReservedInstanceOffering\", \"es:RejectInboundConnection\", \"es:UpdatePackage\" ], \"Resource\": \"*\" } ]\n}\nNoteWhile resource-level permissions for es:CreateDomain might seem unintuitive\u00e2\u0080\u0094after all, why give a user permissions to create a domain that already exists?\u00e2\u0080\u0094the use of a wildcard lets you enforce a simple naming scheme for your domains, such as \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:es:us-west-1:987654321098:domain/my-team-name-*\".\nOf course, nothing prevents you from including actions alongside less restrictive resource elements, such as the following:\n{ \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": [ \"es:ESHttpGet\", \"es:DescribeDomain\" ], \"Resource\": \"*\" } ]\n}\nTo learn more about pairing actions and resources, see the Resource element in this table. Condition\n\nOpenSearch Service supports most conditions that are described in AWS global condition context keys in the IAM User Guide. Notable exceptions include the aws:SecureTransport and aws:PrincipalTag keys, which OpenSearch Service does not support.\nWhen configuring an IP-based policy, you specify the IP addresses or CIDR block as a condition, such as the following:\n\"Condition\": { \"IpAddress\": { \"aws:SourceIp\": [ \"192.0.2.0/32\" ] }\n}\nAs noted in Identity-based policies, the aws:ResourceTag, aws:RequestTag, and aws:TagKeys condition keys only apply to the configuration API, not the OpenSearch APIs. Resource\n\nOpenSearch Service uses Resource elements in three basic ways: For actions that apply to OpenSearch Service itself, like es:ListDomainNames, or to allow full access, use the following syntax:\n\"Resource\": \"*\"\n\nFor actions that involve a domain's configuration, like es:DescribeDomain, you can use the following syntax:\n\"Resource\": \"arn:aws:es:region:aws-account-id:domain/domain-name\"\n\nFor actions that apply to a domain's subresources, like es:ESHttpGet, you can use the following syntax:\n\"Resource\": \"arn:aws:es:region:aws-account-id:domain/domain-name/*\"\nYou don't have to use a wildcard. OpenSearch Service lets you define a different access policy for each OpenSearch index or API. For example, you might limit a user's permissions to the test-index index:\n\"Resource\": \"arn:aws:es:region:aws-account-id:domain/domain-name/test-index\"\nInstead of full access to test-index, you might prefer to limit the policy to just the search API:\n\"Resource\": \"arn:aws:es:region:aws-account-id:domain/domain-name/test-index/_search\"\nYou can even control access to individual documents:\n\"Resource\": \"arn:aws:es:region:aws-account-id:domain/domain-name/test-index/test-type/1\"\nEssentially, if OpenSearch expresses the subresource as a URI, you can control access to it using an access policy. For even more control over which resources a user can access, see Fine-grained access control in Amazon OpenSearch Service.\n\nFor details about which actions support resource-level permissions, see the Action element in this table.",

(Optional) Select Enable migration period for open/IP-based access policy. This setting enables a 30-day transition period during which your existing users can continue to access the domain without disruptions, and existing open and IP-based access policies will continue to work with your domain. During this migration period, we recommend that administrators create the necessary roles and map them to users for the domain. If you use identity-based policies instead of an open or IP-based access policy, you can disable this setting.\nYou also need to update your clients to work with fine-grained access control during the migration period. For example, if you map IAM users with fine-grained access control, you must update your clients to start signing requests with AWS Signature Version 4. If you configure HTTP basic authentication with fine-grained access control, you must update your clients to provide appropriate basic authentication credentials in requests.\nDuring the migration period, users who access the OpenSearch Dashboards endpoint for the domain will land directly on the Discover page rather than the login page. Administrators and master users can choose Login to log in with admin credentials and configure role mappings. \nImportantOpenSearch Service automatically disables the migration period after 30 days.

"text": "To enable SAML authentication for Dashboards (console)\nChoose the domain, Actions and Edit security configuration.\n\nSelect Enable SAML authentication.\n\nNote the service provider entity ID and the two SSO URLs. You only need one of the SSO URLs. For guidance, see SAML configuration overview.\nTipThese URLs change if you later enable a custom endpoint for your domain. In that situation, you must update your IdP.\n\nUse these values to configure your identity provider. This is the most complex part of the process, and unfortunately, terminology and steps vary wildly by provider. Consult your provider's documentation.\nIn Okta, for example, you create a \"SAML 2.0 web application.\" For Single sign on URL, specify the SSO URL that you chose in step 3. For Audience URI (SP Entity ID), specify the SP entity ID.\nRather than users and backend roles, Okta has users and groups. For Group Attribute Statements, we recommend adding role to the Name field and the regular expression .+ to the Filter field. This statement tells the Okta identity provider to include all user groups under the role field of the SAML assertion after a user authenticates.\nIn Auth0, you create a \"regular web application\" and then enable the SAML 2.0 add-on. In Keycloak, you create a \"client.\"\n\nAfter you configure your identity provider, it generates an IdP metadata file. This XML file contains information on the provider, such as a TLS certificate, single sign-on endpoints, and the identity provider's entity ID.\nCopy the contents of the IdP metadata file and paste it into the Metadata from IdP field in the OpenSearch Service console. Alternately, choose Import from XML file and upload the file. The metadata file should look something like this:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<md:EntityDescriptor entityID=\"entity-id\" xmlns:md=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:metadata\"> <md:IDPSSODescriptor WantAuthnRequestsSigned=\"false\" protocolSupportEnumeration=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:protocol\"> <md:KeyDescriptor use=\"signing\"> <ds:KeyInfo xmlns:ds=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#\"> <ds:X509Data> <ds:X509Certificate>tls-certificate</ds:X509Certificate> </ds:X509Data> </ds:KeyInfo> </md:KeyDescriptor> <md:NameIDFormat>urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:unspecified</md:NameIDFormat> <md:NameIDFormat>urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress</md:NameIDFormat> <md:SingleSignOnService Binding=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-POST\" Location=\"idp-sso-url\"/> <md:SingleSignOnService Binding=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-Redirect\" Location=\"idp-sso-url\"/> </md:IDPSSODescriptor>\n</md:EntityDescriptor>\n\nCopy the value of the entityID property from your metadata file and paste it into the IdP entity ID field in the OpenSearch Service console. Many identity providers also display this value as part of a post-configuration summary. Some providers call it the \"issuer\".\n\nProvide a SAML master username and/or a SAML master backend role. This username and/or backend role receives full permissions to the cluster, equivalent to a new master user, but can only use those permissions within Dashboards.\nIn Okta, for example, you might have a user jdoe who belongs to the group admins. If you add jdoe to the SAML master username field, only that user receives full permissions. If you add admins to the SAML master backend role field, any user who belongs to the admins group receives full permissions.\nThe contents of the SAML assertion must exactly match the strings that you use for the SAML master username and/or SAML master role. Some identity providers add a prefix before their usernames, which can cause a hard-to-diagnose mismatch. In the identity provider user interface, you might see jdoe, but the SAML assertion might contain auth0|jdoe. Always use the string from the SAML assertion.\nMany identity providers let you view a sample assertion during the configuration process, and tools like SAML-tracer can help you examine and troubleshoot the contents of real assertions. Assertions look something like this:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<saml2:Assertion ID=\"id67229299299259351343340162\" IssueInstant=\"2020-09-22T22:03:08.633Z\" Version=\"2.0\" xmlns:saml2=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion\"> <saml2:Issuer Format=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:entity\">idp-issuer</saml2:Issuer> <saml2:Subject> <saml2:NameID Format=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:unspecified\">username</saml2:NameID> <saml2:SubjectConfirmation Method=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:cm:bearer\"> <saml2:SubjectConfirmationData NotOnOrAfter=\"2020-09-22T22:08:08.816Z\" Recipient=\"domain-endpoint/_dashboards/_plugins/_security/saml/acs\"/> </saml2:SubjectConfirmation> </saml2:Subject> <saml2:Conditions NotBefore=\"2020-09-22T21:58:08.816Z\" NotOnOrAfter=\"2020-09-22T22:08:08.816Z\"> <saml2:AudienceRestriction> <saml2:Audience>domain-endpoint</saml2:Audience> </saml2:AudienceRestriction> </saml2:Conditions> <saml2:AuthnStatement AuthnInstant=\"2020-09-22T19:54:37.274Z\"> <saml2:AuthnContext> <saml2:AuthnContextClassRef>urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:ac:classes:PasswordProtectedTransport</saml2:AuthnContextClassRef> </saml2:AuthnContext> </saml2:AuthnStatement> <saml2:AttributeStatement> <saml2:Attribute Name=\"role\" NameFormat=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:unspecified\"> <saml2:AttributeValue xmlns:xs=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:type=\"xs:string\">GroupName Match Matches regex \".+\" (case-sensitive) </saml2:AttributeValue> </saml2:Attribute> </saml2:AttributeStatement>\n</saml2:Assertion>\n\n(Optional) Expand Additional settings.\n\nLeave the Subject key field empty to use the NameID element of the SAML assertion for the username. If your assertion doesn't use this standard element and instead includes the username as a custom attribute, specify that attribute here.\nIf you want to use backend roles (recommended), specify an attribute from the assertion in the Role key field, such as role or group. This is another situation in which tools like SAML-tracer can help.\n\nBy default, OpenSearch Dashboards logs users out after 24 hours. You can configure this value to any number between 60 and 1,440 (24 hours) by specifying the Session time to live.\n\nChoose Save changes. The domain enters a processing state for approximately one minute, during which time Dashboards is unavailable.\n\nAfter the domain finishes processing, open Dashboards. If you chose the SP-initiated URL, navigate to domain-endpoint/_dashboards/.\n\nIf you chose the IdP-initiated URL, navigate to your identity provider's application directory.\n\nIn both cases, log in as either the SAML master user or a user who belongs to the SAML master backend role. To continue the example from step 7, log in as either jdoe or a member of the admins group.\n\nAfter Dashboards loads, choose Security and Roles.\n\nMap roles to allow other users to access Dashboards.\nFor example, you might map your trusted colleague jroe to the all_access and security_manager roles. You might also map the backend role analysts to the readall and kibana_user roles.\nIf you prefer to use the API rather than Dashboards, see the following sample request:\nPATCH _plugins/_security/api/rolesmapping\n[ { \"op\": \"add\", \"path\": \"/security_manager\", \"value\": { \"users\": [\"master-user\", \"jdoe\", \"jroe\"], \"backend_roles\": [\"admins\"] } }, { \"op\": \"add\", \"path\": \"/all_access\", \"value\": { \"users\": [\"master-user\", \"jdoe\", \"jroe\"], \"backend_roles\": [\"admins\"] } }, { \"op\": \"add\", \"path\": \"/readall\", \"value\": { \"backend_roles\": [\"analysts\"] } }, { \"op\": \"add\", \"path\": \"/kibana_user\", \"value\": { \"backend_roles\": [\"analysts\"] } }\n]",

The destination domain evaluates this request against its domain access policy. You must include the es:ESCrossClusterGet permission on the destination domain:\n{ \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Principal\": { \"AWS\": \"*\" }, \"Action\": \"es:ESCrossClusterGet\", \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:es:region:account:domain/dst-domain\" } ]\n}\nMake sure that the es:ESCrossClusterGet permission is applied for /dst-domain and not /dst-domain/*.\nHowever, this minimum policy only allows cross-cluster searches. To perform other operations, such as indexing documents and performing standard searches, you need additional permissions.

We recommend at least one to prevent data loss. Replicas also improve search performance, so you might want more if you have a read-heavy workload. Use PUT /my-index/_settings to update the number_of_replicas setting for your index.\n\nOpenSearch indexing overhead: The on-disk size of an index varies, but is often 10% larger than the source data. After indexing your data, you can use the _cat/indices?v API and pri.store.size value to calculate the exact overhead. _cat/allocation?v also provides a useful summary.\n\nOperating system reserved space: By default, Linux reserves 5% of the file system for the root user for critical processes, system recovery, and to safeguard against disk fragmentation problems.\n\nOpenSearch Service overhead: OpenSearch Service reserves 20% of the storage space of each instance (up to 20 GiB) for segment merges, logs, and other internal operations.\nBecause of this 20 GiB maximum, the total amount of reserved space can vary dramatically depending on the number of instances in your domain. For example, a domain might have three m6g.xlarge.search instances, each with 500 GiB of storage space, for a total of 1.46 TiB. In this case, the total reserved space is only 60 GiB. Another domain might have 10 m3.medium.search instances, each with 100 GiB of storage space, for a total of 0.98 TiB. Here, the total reserved space is 200 GiB, even though the first domain is 50% larger.\nIn the following formula, we apply a \"worst-case\" estimate for overhead that includes additional free space to help minimize the impact of node failures and Availability Zone outages.",

"text": "Creating domains\n\nDomains of this size exceed the default limit of 40 instances per domain. To request a service limit increase of up to 200 instances per domain, open a case at the AWS Support Center.\n\nPricing\n\nBefore creating a domain of this size, check the Amazon OpenSearch Service pricing page to ensure that the associated costs match your expectations. Examine UltraWarm storage for Amazon OpenSearch Service to see if a hot-warm architecture fits your use case.\n\nStorage\n\nThe i3 instance types are designed to provide fast, local non-volatile memory express (NVMe) storage. Because this local storage tends to offer performance benefits when compared to Amazon Elastic Block Store, EBS volumes are not an option when you select these instance types in OpenSearch Service. If you prefer EBS storage, use another instance type, such as r5.12xlarge.search.\n\nShard size and count\n\nA common OpenSearch guideline is not to exceed 50 GB per shard. Given the number of shards necessary to accommodate large domains and the resources available to i3.16xlarge.search instances, we recommend a shard size of 100 GB.\nFor example, if you have 450 TB of source data and want one replica, your minimum storage requirement is closer to 450 TB * 2 * 1.1 / 0.95 = 1.04 PB. For an explanation of this calculation, see Calculating storage requirements. Although 1.04 PB / 15 TB = 70 instances, you might select 90 or more i3.16xlarge.search instances to give yourself a storage safety net, deal with node failures, and account for some variance in the amount of data over time. Each instance adds another 20 GiB to your minimum storage requirement, but for disks of this size, those 20 GiB are almost negligible.\nControlling the number of shards is tricky. OpenSearch users often rotate indices on a daily basis and retain data for a week or two. In this situation, you might find it useful to distinguish between \"active\" and \"inactive\" shards. Active shards are, well, actively being written to or read from. Inactive shards might service some read requests, but are largely idle. In general, you should keep the number of active shards below a few thousand. As the number of active shards approaches 10,000, considerable performance and stability risks emerge.\nTo calculate the number of primary shards, use this formula: 450,000 GB * 1.1 / 100 GB per shard = 4,950 shards. Doubling that number to account for replicas is 9,900 shards, which represents a major concern if all shards are active. But if you rotate indices and only 1/7th or 1/14th of the shards are active on any given day (1,414 or 707 shards, respectively), the cluster might work well. As always, the most important step of sizing and configuring your domain is to perform representative client testing using a realistic dataset.",

You receive a validation exception if you try to create a domain with only one dedicated master node.\n\nTwo dedicated master nodes means that your cluster doesn't have the necessary quorum of nodes to elect a new master node in the event of a failure.\nA quorum is the number of dedicated master nodes / 2 + 1 (rounded down to the nearest whole number), which OpenSearch Service sets to discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes when you create your domain.\nIn this case, 2 / 2 + 1 = 2. Because one dedicated master node has failed and only one backup exists, the cluster doesn't have a quorum and can't elect a new master.\n\nThree dedicated master nodes, the recommended number, provides two backup nodes in the event of a master node failure and the necessary quorum (2) to elect a new master.\n\nFour dedicated master nodes are no better than three and can cause issues if you use multiple Availability Zones. If one master node fails, you have the quorum (3) to elect a new master. If two nodes fail, you lose that quorum, just as you do with three dedicated master nodes.\n\nIn a three Availability Zone configuration, two AZs have one dedicated master node, and one AZ has two. If that AZ experiences a disruption, the remaining two AZs don't have the necessary quorum (3) to elect a new master. Having five dedicated master nodes works as well as three and allows you to lose two nodes while maintaining a quorum.

"text": "ChangeDescriptionDateSingle Kibana 5.6 supportAmazon OpenSearch Service adds support for single Kibana 5.6.16. With single Kibana 5.6.16, you can use Kibana 5.6 as your front end while connecting to Elasticsearch versions 5.1, 5.3, 5.5, and 5.6. You must be on service software R20220323 or later to use single Kibana 5.6.April 4, 2022R20220323-P1Amazon OpenSearch Service recently released service software update R20220323, but the update was subsequently rolled back because of an issue. We recommend that you update your domains to patch release R20220323-P1 or later, which fixes the issue.April 4, 2022OpenSearch 1.2 supportAmazon OpenSearch Service now supports OpenSearch version 1.2. For more information, see the 1.2 release notes.April 4, 2022ObservabilityThe default installation of OpenSearch Dashboards for Amazon OpenSearch Service includes the Observability plugin, which you can use to visualize data-driven events using Piped Processing Language (PPL) to explore and query your data. The plugin requires OpenSearch 1.2 or later and service software R20220323 or later.April 4, 2022Kibana 7.7.1 supportAmazon OpenSearch Service domains running Elasticsearch 7.7 now support the latest patch release for Kibana 7.7, which adds bug fixes and improves security. When you update your 7.7 domains to service software R20220323 or later, OpenSearch Service will automatically upgrade them to this patch release.April 4, 2022JVM memory pressure metric changesAmazon OpenSearch Service changed the logic for the JVMMemoryPressure CloudWatch metrics to more accurately reflect memory utilization. Previously, the metrics only considered the old generation memory pool of JVM heap. With this change, the metric also considers the young generation memory pool. After you update your domain to service software R20220323, you might see an increase in the JVMMemoryPressure, MasterJVMMemoryPressure, and/or WarmJVMMemoryPressure metrics.April 4, 2022Custom dictionaries with the IK (Chinese) Analysis pluginAmazon OpenSearch Service now supports using custom dictionaries with the IK (Chinese) Analysis plugin.April 4, 2022Cross-cluster search and replication on existing domainsAmazon OpenSearch Service removed the limitation that you can only implement cross-cluster search and cross-cluster replication on domains created on or after June 3rd, 2020.

A good rule of thumb is to try to keep shard size between 10\u00e2\u0080\u009350 GiB. Large shards can make it difficult for OpenSearch to recover from failure, but because each shard uses some amount of CPU and memory, having too many small shards can cause performance issues and out of memory errors. In other words, shards should be small enough that the underlying OpenSearch Service instance can handle them, but not so small that they place needless strain on the hardware.",

Remember, though, you don't have those extra 198 GiB of data yet. Check to make sure that this preparation for the future doesn't create unnecessarily tiny shards that consume huge amounts of CPU and memory in the present. In this case, 66 * 1.1 / 10 shards = 7.26 GiB per shard, which will consume extra resources and is below the recommended size range. You might consider the more middle-of-the-road approach of six shards, which leaves you with 12 GiB shards today and 48 GiB shards in the future.
